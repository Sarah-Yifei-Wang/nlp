"the recovery in the united states and other advanced economies has been proceeding too slowly to provide jobs for millions of unemployed people."
"indeed, the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008--a distressing development made all the worse by the fact that new entrants have, of course, continued to come into the labor force in recent years."
"the fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for six months or more stands at a very high level."
"in addition to those officially unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out of the labor force entirely."
"i'm here because the men and women in military service, like all americans, are profoundly affected by the economic challenges our nation has faced these past several years."
"you may have family members who have had trouble finding employment in a tough job market."
"you may be worried about your own job prospects when the time comes for you to leave the military."
"just this tuesday i met with holly petraeus, head of the office of servicemembers affairs in the new consumer financial protection bureau."
"ms. petraeus and i share a common commitment to ensuring that the men and women who protect the security of our country are themselves protected from predatory lending and other abusive financial practices."
"our economy has been growing and adding jobs for more than two years now."
"the unemployment rate remains painfully high, and more than two-fifths of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than six months, by far the highest ratio since world war ii."
"these problems are very serious, and we at the federal reserve have been focusing intently on supporting job creation."
"supporting job creation is half of our marching orders, so to speak; the other half is controlling inflation."
"the law's purpose is to allow servicemembers to perform their duties without worry of foreclosure, eviction, and civil prosecution--under most circumstances."
"it caps interest rates for debts incurred before a servicemember begins active duty, it prevents creditors from foreclosing on a home or repossessing a car without a court order, it gives servicemembers the option to terminate residential property and motor vehicle leases, it stays civil proceedings while servicemembers are on active duty, and it entitles servicemembers to reinstatement of health insurance that was in effect before their military service began."
"first, while you are in the military, take advantage of training opportunities."
"many specific skills learned in the military--nursing and healthcare, mechanics, computer programming, police and security work--transfer to civilian jobs."
"the military also offers training in various life skills."
"for instance, this morning i visited the fort bliss army community service training center, which offers classes on such financial topics as budgeting, debt management, understanding credit, car buying, and protecting against identity theft."
"more broadly, according to a recent study, 80 percent of veterans said their military experience helped them get ahead in life.1  they said the experience helped them mature, taught them to work with others, and built their self-confidence."
"the value of military experience is reflected in the fact that the unemployment rate for veterans tends to be lower than the rate for non-veterans.2           second, when you leave the military, take advantage of education benefits for veterans."
"keep in mind that, on average, compared with high school graduates, people with college degrees earn about twice as much and suffer about half the rate of unemployment.3           finally, educate yourself about your own personal finances."
"research by the federal reserve right here at fort bliss shows that financial education can pay off.4  beginning in 2003, the federal reserve collaborated with army emergency relief, the u.s. army's own financial assistance organization, to provide a two-day financial education course, taught by the staff of san diego city college, to younger enlisted soldiers--mostly men in their early 20s."
"see pew research center (2011), ""war and sacrifice in the post-9/11 era: the military-civilian gap""  (washington: prc, october 5)."
"in october 2011, the unemployment rate was 7.7 percent for veterans and 8.8 percent for non-veterans (not seasonally adjusted, age 18 and older)."
"these complementary supervisory tools serve two related functions."
"unlike the first two threads, there is no international framework that parallels our domestic changes, though stress testing is receiving increased attention in a number of other jurisdictions."
"we will also discuss the unique challenges faced by women- and minority-owned firms."
"we hope to be as concrete and practical as possible; for example, several conference papers assess the extent to which training, technical assistance, and other resources are available to support these and other small firms."
"many small business owners have had to lay off employees or defer hiring."
"the role of small businesses and entrepreneurship in job creation will be discussed in our first panel today."
"we need to think carefully about how, in the current economic environment, our nation can best provide small businesses and entrepreneurs with the support they need to expand job opportunities."
"forum participants emphasized the need to support organizations that offer valuable technical assistance and training programs, including state and regional economic development offices, small business development centers, community colleges, technical schools, and rural cooperative extension offices."
"i am proud to see our city recognizes that helping families plan for a more secure financial future is good for citizens and, at the same time, it makes the economic base of the entire city stronger."
"financially stable families also make the economy run more smoothly as these families face less economic risk and have more economic mobility."
"the statistics may show that the consumer sector of our economy is improving, but i know that financial instability remains a reality for many families and i am quite aware of the difficult questions and painful decisions many of them face every day."
"the dallas fed makes building wealth available online in both english and spanish, and has created an interactive version of the publication, making it usable as a personal finance education resource for schools, nonprofit community organizations, and financial services providers.4          another valuable online resource is the federal reserve bank of san francisco's guide to financial literacy."
"starting salaries for recent college graduates have declined, which means that young americans who are employed have fewer resources for saving and investing than previous generations."
"according to an analysis by vanguard, hardship withdrawals increased by 49 percent between 2005 and 2010.6          the increasing use of retirement savings for other purposes is particularly problematic now that employers have increasingly shifted the responsibility for saving for retirement toward individual employees."

"not surprisingly, the unemployment rate has declined only 1 percentage point from its high of about 10 percent near the end of 2009, and the number of jobs in the private sector remains more than 6 million below the peak level reached in early 2008."
"the fraction of those now jobless who have been without work for six months or more stands at a very high level."
"and, in addition to those officially unemployed, many individuals are involuntarily working part time or have dropped out of the labor force entirely."
"furthermore, recent surveys have shown some deterioration in firms' hiring plans, and new claims for unemployment insurance by workers who have been laid off remain relatively high."
"in the government sector, with ongoing pressures on their budgets, state and local governments have continued to shrink their payrolls and reduce their spending on construction projects."
"a subcommittee on communication, chaired by governor yellen and composed of presidents evans and plosser and governor raskin, is reviewing additional ways to enhance the effectiveness of communications with the public about monetary policy."
"but it is hard to justify characterizing in any less urgent fashion the circumstances of the nearly 30 million americans who are officially unemployed, out of the labor force but wanting jobs, or involuntarily working only part time."
"the state of the labor market today        let me start with some basic statistics that summarize the current state of the labor market."
"unemployment rates are exceptionally elevated for certain subgroups of the population: nearly 15 percent for workers without a high school education, 16 percent among african americans, about 25 percent among all teenagers, and nearly 50 percent for african american teenagers."
"about 9 million workers who would like a full-time job can find only part-time work."
"millions of others are working at jobs for which they are likely overqualified and earning less than in their previous jobs."
"meanwhile, another 6 million people who are not officially counted among the unemployed say that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one, in many cases because they have become discouraged by the poor state of the job market."
"the proportion of the u.s. population that is employed now stands at about 58 percent, the lowest level since 1983."
"finally, more than 6 million workers--nearly one-half of all the unemployed--have been jobless for more than six months."
"the level of payroll employment fell by nearly 9 million during and just after the recession."
"the pace of job growth in recent quarters has been barely enough to absorb the increase in the labor force and wholly insufficient to produce meaningful declines in unemployment."
"the number of new claims for unemployment insurance suggests only modest gains in employment in coming months, while measures of job vacancies seem to have turned down."
"in particular, some explanations offered for the weak labor market recovery following the past two recessions are clearly not relevant today."
"first, it is apparent that job reallocation--that is, the sum of the jobs created at some businesses and lost in others--has been in secular decline since the late 1990s."
"second, the amount of employee movement across jobs has fallen over time."
"so has the rate at which workers quit jobs, an indication of the degree to which they believe there are better jobs available for them."
"adjusting for inflation, earnings for a worker in the middle of the wage distribution have risen about 10 percent since 1980, while earnings for a highly paid worker at the 90th percentile of the wage distribution have risen more than 30 percent during the same period."
"since 1980, the average wage for college graduates has increased from about one and a half times the average wage for workers with only a high school degree to about two times their wage."
"""4 this theory posits that the diffusion of computer-related technologies, the related automation of routine work, and an increased capability for firms to move their activities offshore have combined to concentrate job creation in the poles of either high-skill, high-wage employment or low-skill, low-wage work."
"the kinds of workers who would have been employed in a traditional manufacturing or administrative job now often end up in lower-paying jobs."
"younger workers have historically filled many of the lower-paying service-sector jobs that are now more likely to be taken by less-educated adults."
"thus, occupational polarization may be responsible for some of the rapid decline in employment and labor force participation among young people over the past decade."
"the most common argument is that the deep recession created serious difficulties in matching available workers to available jobs, resulting in a big increase in structural unemployment."
"one such labor market feature is the sharp reduction in employment in sectors related to the housing bubble, such as residential construction and some parts of financial services."
"the contention is that the skills of workers in these sectors do not readily transfer to other sectors, and thus they will have a particularly difficult time finding new jobs."
"but in every recession, certain industries and occupations are hit particularly hard, resulting in significant permanent job losses."
"the claim is that those without the skills sought by employers will take longer, on average, to find new employment."
"another argument for the structural unemployment hypothesis is that the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment has recently changed."
"the argument is that the shift reflects an increase in job mismatch, with the vacancies going unfilled because of structural reasons such as lack of geographic mobility or appropriate skills."
"the big increase in job loss during the recession is probably a factor, as sharp increases in layoffs overwhelm the matching process."
"it may also be that during serious downturns, more workers who would have given up looking for a job continue to look in order to qualify for extended and emergency unemployment benefits, or that employers take longer to fill vacancies when the labor market is weak.9           an analysis by federal reserve board economists that decomposes the shift in the beveridge curve into its various components does point to some increase in structural unemployment related to a reduction in the efficiency with which unemployed workers are matched to vacant jobs--that is, mismatch.10 however, the estimated increase is fairly modest--on the order of 1 percentage point--relative to the total increase in the unemployment rate experienced in recent years."
"by examining imbalances between the occupations, industries, and geographic locations in which vacancies are concentrated and those in which unemployment is concentrated, they constructed an index of potential mismatch."
"the unusually long duration of unemployment spells and high fraction of the labor force unemployed for more than six months raise the prospect that the long-term unemployed will become progressively less employable as their skills, reputations, and networks deteriorate."
"whole cadres of workers, whether younger people leaving school at a time of high unemployment or older workers losing long-time jobs, might never regain the career trajectory on which they were headed."
"i certainly do not disagree that well-conceived policies by other parts of the government could produce gains in employment, investment, and spending."
"it is easy to echo the nearly universal call for improvements in education, innovation in retraining, and other more effective labor market policies."
"but i do want to emphasize that the challenge is more than determining which education and training policies are both effective and affordable."
"the nation needs a model for economic growth that will generate innovation and productivity enhancements that will, in turn, generate the kinds of jobs for which we hope we are educating and training our people."
"to date, researchers have been hard-pressed to uncover an explanation for all these declines in worker mobility."
"in principle, these trends could also reflect improving efficiencies in the labor market, such as screening and hiring techniques that result in better matches between firms and workers, though this more benign explanation strikes me as less likely against the overall backdrop of labor markets in the past decade."

"according to this view, prospective workers are unwilling to accept wage rates low enough to induce businesses to hire and increase production."
"however, it is hard to see why this phenomenon would be any stronger now than in earlier recessions, when a greater fraction of the u.s. workforce was covered by collective-bargaining agreements."
"wage rates have decelerated across a broad range of industries and occupations, and unit labor costs have fallen sharply."
"i'm also excited to be with you this morning because i began my time as commissioner of financial regulation for the state of maryland in the heat of the financial crisis, and i am keenly aware that maryland's lawyers came together in a show of massive pro bono strength to help homeowners confronting unprecedented numbers of foreclosures in the state."
"this work continues in various ways, including most recently the announcement that the state of maryland will be participating in the launch of hope loan port, the country's first web-based foreclosure mediation portal."
"lawyers in maryland consistently have been on the forefront in supporting mediation systems to resolve issues between homeowners and servicers."
"while many were surprised by the news, this is something that we had been dealing with here in maryland more than three years ago; as many of you know from having worked on these issues, we had identified serious servicing problems as early as 2008 in maryland, had analyzed them quite extensively, and had crafted some effective legal, administrative, and legislative early responses."
"for example,  the federal banking regulators found significant problems when we looked at mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing at 14 federally regulated mortgage servicers, which collectively represent more than two-thirds of all servicing volume nationally."
"individual consumers have been harmed by this negligence, including the negligence of law firms."
"servicers are also reimbursed for some expenses, such as the cost of a title search when pursuing a foreclosure, but generally not for unanticipated overhead or labor costs."
"a servicer primarily processes mortgage payments and minimizes labor and overhead costs by harnessing economies of scale and automating the process as much as possible."
"this is a massive challenge for lawyers who practice in the field of mortgage finance and your country needs you to tackle it with the same vigor and energy that you have brought to other legal challenges in this housing crisis."

"for example, strong educational systems producing increasingly skilled workforces have proven crucial for climbing the technological ladder."
"the evidence suggests that these programs enhance the quality of the economy's labor forcewhile addressing social goals such as reducing gender and income inequality."
"it is no coincidence that so many high-tech firms locate near each other in california's silicon valley or north carolina's research triangle; these firms benefit from the ability to draw on sufficiently large pools of skilled labor and other resources, while sharing ideas and information in mutually beneficial ways.13 a single, isolated firm would not likely be as productive."

"the latest employment report issued by the bureau of labor statistics was bleak."
"private-sector employers added only 17,000 nonfarm jobs in august, far fewer than the already weak average monthly gain of about 110,000 recorded over the previous three months."
"the headline unemployment rate was 9.1 percent, representing about 14 million americans who were out of work in august."
"nonetheless, as many families know, the headline unemployment numbers don't fully capture the weakness in labor market conditions."
"beyond the headline number, an additional 8.8 million workers were classified as ""part time for economic reasons"" in august because their hours had been cut back or they were unable to find a full-time job."
"in addition, about 2-1/2 million americans were classified as ""marginally attached"" to the labor force because even though they wanted to get a job, they had not searched for one in the past four weeks."
"i have visited unemployment insurance offices and job training centers, and i have met lots of people who have been out of work for more than a year or two--out of work for so long that some of them are embarrassed to show their resumes to potential employers."
"of course, substantial uncertainty surrounds various specific estimates, but there should be no doubt that the fomc's forceful actions helped mitigate the consequences of the crisis and thereby spared american families and businesses from even greater pain."
"given the elevated rate of unemployment and the large number of individuals who are experiencing long spells of unemployment, both fiscal and monetary policymakers should be considering a wide array of approaches for promoting job creation."
"in thinking about this issue, i was also reminded of the older work on how product differentiation may substitute for price competition in concentrated industries."
"indeed, the u.s. trade deficit has narrowed substantially relative to where it was before the crisis, reflecting in part the improved competitiveness of u.s. goods and services."
"depressed construction also has hurt providers of a wide range of goods and services related to housing and homebuilding, such as the household appliance and home furnishing industries."
"for example, state and local governments continue to tighten their belts by cutting spending and reducing payrolls in the face of ongoing budgetary pressures, and federal fiscal stimulus is being withdrawn."
"notably, because of ongoing weakness in labor demand over the course of the recovery, nominal wage increases have been roughly offset by productivity gains, leaving the level of unit labor costs close to where it had stood at the onset of the recession."
"economic policymakers face a range of difficult decisions, and every household and business must cope with the stresses and uncertainties that our current situation presents."
"this is important work, and i appreciate your participation in the forum today."
"in the broader economy, manufacturing production in the united states has risen nearly 15 percent since its trough, driven substantially by growth in exports."
"indeed, the u.s. trade deficit has been notably lower recently than it was before the crisis, reflecting in part the improved competitiveness of u.s. goods and services."
"business investment in equipment and software has continued to expand, and productivity gains in some industries have been impressive, though new data have reduced estimates of overall productivity improvement in recent years."
"the low level of construction has implications not only for builders but for providers of a wide range of goods and services related to housing and homebuilding."
"our k-12 educational system, despite considerable strengths, poorly serves a substantial portion of our population."
"our economy is suffering today from an extraordinarily high level of long-term unemployment, with nearly half of the unemployed having been out of work for more than six months."
"in the short term, putting people back to work reduces the hardships inflicted by difficult economic times and helps ensure that our economy is producing at its full potential rather than leaving productive resources fallow."
"to the fullest extent possible, our nation's tax and spending policies should increase incentives to work and to save, encourage investments in the skills of our workforce, stimulate private capital formation, promote research and development, and provide necessary public infrastructure."
"economic policymakers face a range of difficult decisions, relating to both the short-run and long-run challenges we face."
"one of the tragedies of our current lingering recession is that so many young americans have not been able to experience the thrilling rite of passage that comes with finding a stable and decent-paying job."
"and, of course, even beyond the young, there are millions of americans stuck in unemployment lines desperate to find a way back into the productive economy."
"i believe that this imperative has broad importance in american social and economic life."
"the latest employment report issued by the bureau of labor statistics was bleak.1 u.s. employers in may added only 54,000 non-farm jobs, down from 232,000 jobs added in april."
"the headline unemployment rate was 9.1 percent in may, representing about 13.9 million americans out of work."
"there are an additional 8.5 million workers who are ""part-time-of-necessity"" or ""underemployed"" because their hours have been cut back or they are unable to find a full-time job; there are also 1.4 million workers who are ""marginally attached"" to the labor force because, while wanting a job, they have not searched for one in the past four weeks; and there are 822,000 ""discouraged"" workers who have given up searching for employment because they do not believe any jobs are available for them.2           so it is not just those who are currently collecting unemployment insurance payments who are excluded."

"as you know, the jobs situation remains far from normal."
"for example, aggregate hours of production workers--a comprehensive measure of labor input that reflects the extent of part-time employment and opportunities for overtime as well as the number of people employed--fell, remarkably, by nearly 10 percent from the beginning of the recent recession through october 2009."
"other indicators, such as total payroll employment, the ratio of employment to population, and the unemployment rate, paint a similar picture."
"particularly concerning is the very high level of long-term unemployment--nearly half of the unemployed have been jobless for more than six months."
"people without work for long periods can find it increasingly difficult to obtain a job comparable to their previous one, as their skills tend to deteriorate over time and as employers are often reluctant to hire the long-term unemployed."
"capital spending on equipment and software has continued to expand, reflecting an improving sales outlook and the need to replace aging capital."
"in contrast, virtually all segments of the construction industry remain troubled."

"the increasing use of retirement savings for other purposes is particularly troubling given that the responsibility for saving for retirement has shifted away from employers to individual employees."
"workers have either chosen to leave the work force early in the last few years or, more likely, have applied for social security benefits as early as possible because of the weak job market.1 opting to receive a smaller social security annuity earlier in life is just one of many hard decisions americans have had to make in order to balance their short-term and long-term financial needs."

"that capacity, in turn, depends importantly on the supply of qualified scientists, engineers, and other technical workers."
"although the system of higher education in the united states remains among the finest in the world, numerous concerns have been raised about this country's ability to ensure adequate supplies of highly skilled workers."
"the technological leadership of the united states was and continues to be built in substantial part on the contributions of foreign-born scientists and engineers, both permanent immigrants and those staying in the country only for a time."
"and, contrary to the notion that highly trained and talented immigrants displace native-born workers in the labor market, scientists and other highly trained professionals who come to the united states tend to enhance the productivity and employment opportunities of those already here, reflecting gains from interaction and cooperation and from the development of critical masses of researchers in technical areas."

"concern over credit availability for small businesses has appropriately been a recurring worry throughout the crisis, but information about the intersection between business performance, personal finances, and credit has been hard to find."
"the survey clearly shows a high degree of interdependence of personal and business finances for many families with businesses."
"but we must recognize that countries face diverse challenges in such a transition."
"i will focus this evening on a top challenge not only for new york, but also for states and localities across the nation--namely, the imperative of achieving fiscal sustainability in both the short and the long term."
"meanwhile, on the spending side of the ledger, demand for publicly financed medical care and other public services soared as the economy weakened."
"nonetheless, many governments have laid off or furloughed workers, frozen salaries, and cut other operating expenses."
"job cuts have been especially pronounced at the local level, where payrolls have fallen roughly 350,000, or more than 2 percent, over the past 2-1/2 years; nearly half of the loss of local jobs has been in education."
"one might ask why states and localities are choosing to reduce capital expenditures, as these expenditures provide employment and economic benefits while typically not being subject to balanced budget requirements."
"despite the many difficult adjustments to date, state and local fiscal repair is far from complete, and governors, mayors, and legislators will confront more tough decisions as they develop their budgets for fiscal year 2012."
"although the economy is recovering, it is still operating well below potential and unemployment remains high."
"indeed, with the retirement of public employees who are part of the baby-boom generation and the continued rise in health-care costs, meeting obligations for pension and retiree health-care expenses will become increasingly difficult for many states and localities."
"estimates of state and local governments' unfunded pension liabilities for the nation as a whole span a wide range, with some researchers putting the figure in the neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion.2 some governments are beginning to take difficult steps to address this problem, although their ability to change plan provisions is limited by the strong legal protection (including, in some states, constitutional protection) accorded to accrued pension benefits of public employees in many jurisdictions.3           state and local governments also will have to address the burgeoning costs of retiree health benefits."
"for example, one recent estimate suggests that state governments have a collective liability of almost $600 billion for retiree health benefits.4           not all of the longer-term issues facing state and local fiscal authorities involve closing budget gaps."
"the payoffs of early childhood programs can be especially high.7 for instance, preschool programs for disadvantaged children have been shown to increase high school graduation rates.8 because high school graduates have higher earnings, pay more taxes, and are less likely to use public health programs, investing in such programs can pay off even from the narrow perspective of state budgets; of course, the returns to the overall economy and to the individuals themselves are much greater."
"additionally, in a dynamic economy in which job requirements are evolving more rapidly than ever, individuals already in the workforce need opportunities to improve their skills throughout their lives."
"for example, community colleges and vocational schools train and retrain workers, often in close collaboration with private employers, and in many cases they perform this function at a relatively low cost."
"although helping workers acquire up-to-date skills is always important, it is especially critical now, when long spells of unemployment are threatening the longer-term employability and productivity of many."
"conclusion        tonight i have highlighted some of the fiscal challenges faced by elected officials, both in new york and in other regions."
"moreover, states and localities are facing difficult longer-run issues related to pension and health-related expenses for their retired employees."

"these problems existed before november and as far as i can tell they remain unaddressed."
"businesses' investments in new equipment and software grew robustly over most of last year, as firms replaced aging equipment and as the demand for their products and services expanded."
"following the loss of about 8â1/2 million jobs in 2008 and 2009, private-sector employment showed gains in 2010."
"however, these gains were barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates and other new entrants to the labor force and, therefore, not enough to significantly reduce the overall unemployment rate."
"recent data do provide some grounds for optimism on the employment front; for example, initial claims for unemployment insurance have generally been trending down, and indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans have improved."
"in particular, it bears emphasizing that we have the necessary tools to smoothly and effectively exit from the asset purchase program at the appropriate time."

"in addition, a historically large fraction of the unemployed have been out of a job for a very long time."
"for example, roughly 4 percentage points of today's unemployment rate reflects individuals who have been unemployed for half a year or more."
"those who experience an extended period of unemployment face a risk of losing their ability to participate successfully in the workforce, lending additional urgency to the task of reviving the demand for labor."
"those simulation results indicate that by 2012, the full program of securities purchases will have raised private payroll employment by about 3 million jobs."
"is the program actually proving effective?"
"in particular, the shift may partly reflect a decline in the efficiency with which unemployed workers are matched to vacant jobs.14 however, given that the apparent decline in matching efficiency coincided with a large reduction in job vacancies, the two developments may be related."
"another portion of the recent outward shift in the beveridge curve is likely due to increases in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits, which may have induced some unemployed workers to be more selective in the job offers they accept."
"possible reasons for a decline in matching efficiency include decreased mobility of workers due to the drop in house prices and a mismatch between the skills demanded by businesses and the skills offered by unemployed workers."
"indicators of hiring and job openings have continued to rise in recent months, and, more recently, new claims for unemployment insurance have begun falling again."
"still, 18 months into recovery, there are more than 7 million fewer jobs in the economy than there were just prior to the recession, and the unemployment rate remains stubbornly close to its peak."
"as i noted earlier, the financial crisis and severe recession left the economy far below levels of resource utilization consistent with maximum sustained employment."
"the research discussed in conferences such as this one will help us better understand and respond to these challenges."

"moreover, many other features of the jobs market, including the historically high level of long-term unemployment, the large number of people working part time because they have not been able to find full-time jobs, and the decline in labor force participation, reinforce the conclusion that we have some way to go before the labor market can be deemed healthy again."
"for example, the extraordinarily severe job losses that followed the crisis, especially in housing-related industries, may have exacerbated for a time the extent of mismatch between the jobs available and the skills and locations of the unemployed."
"meanwhile, the very high level of long-term unemployment has probably led to some loss of skills and labor force attachment among those workers."
"weaker economic conditions in europe and other parts of the world have also weighed on u.s. exports and corporate earnings."
"in response to a large and sustained decline in their tax revenues, state and local governments have cut about 600,000 jobs on net since the third quarter of 2008 while reducing real expenditures for infrastructure projects by 20 percent."
"(for a discussion, see ben s. bernanke (2012), ""recent developments in the labor market,"" speech delivered at the national association for business economics 28th annual economic policy conference, arlington, va., march 26.)"
"in addition, while the changing relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--the shift in the beveridge curve--probably does point to some greater difficulty matching jobs with workers, factors other than mismatch likely explain some of that shift."
"for example, evidence suggests that firms tend to become more selective in hiring when their hiring needs are not urgent."
"my colleagues and i have been and remain quite concerned about the stubbornly high level of unemployment--particularly long-term unemployment."
"one of the advantages of working at the federal reserve is having access to what i believe is one of the finest research staffs anywhere."

"at the federal reserve we spend a lot of time looking at economic data, such as production and employment."
"when individuals are denied opportunities to reach their maximum potential, it harms not only those individuals, of course, but also the larger economy, which depends vitally on having a skilled, productive workforce."
"the research shows that effective educations lead to lower rates of poverty, higher lifetime earnings, and greater satisfaction on the job and at home."
"notably, a portion of these economic returns accrues to the children themselves and their families, but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority of the benefits, reflecting the many contributions that skilled and productive workers make to the economy.7           the federal reserve has long supported increasing educational opportunity for children, including the youngest."
"see, respectively, leonard n. masse and w. steven barnett (2002), a benefit-cost analysis of the abecedarian early childhood intervention, report (new brunswick, n.j.: national institute for early education research, september); and lynn a. karoly, peter w. greenwood, susan s. everingham, jill houbé, m. rebecca kilburn, c. peter rydell, matthew sanders, and james chiesa (1998), investing in our children: what we know and don't know about the costs and benefits of early childhood interventions, report (santa monica, calif.: rand corporation)."
"there is a rich and growing academic literature devoted to this task."
"the unemployment rate is almost 1 percentage point lower than it was a year ago, but we are still far from full employment."
"currently, the unemployment rate stands around 3 percentage points above where it was at the onset of the recession--a figure that is stark enough as it is, but does not even take account of the millions more who have left the labor force or who would have joined under more normal circumstances in the past four years."
"and the red dotted line is an index of firms' ability to fill jobs, based on a survey conducted by the national federation of independent business."
"this similarity runs counter to claims that the cbo's and other estimates of the unemployment gap overstate the true amount of slack by placing insufficient weight on structural explanations, such as a reduced efficiency of matching workers to jobs, for the rise in unemployment since 2007."
"slide 7  the solid blue bars in figure 4 present a snapshot of the distribution of nominal wage changes for individual jobs during the depth of the current labor market slump, based on data collected by the bureau of labor statistics.6 for comparison, the dashed red line presents a hypothetical distribution of wage changes, using a normal distribution that approximates the actual distribution of wage changes greater than zero."
"the distribution of actual wage changes shows that a relatively high percentage of workers saw no change in their nominal wage, and relatively few experienced modest wage cuts."
"continued high unemployment could wreak long-term damage by eroding the skills and labor force attachment of workers suffering long-term unemployment, thereby turning what was initially cyclical into structural unemployment."
"in addition, many potential homebuyers are delaying home purchases because they are worried about their income or employment prospects."
"many households have faced job losses or large reductions in the number of hours worked, events that have reduced family income and well-being."
"nationally, employment decreased by nearly 9 million, while the unemployment rate climbed from roughly 5 percent to 10 percent."
"moreover, the number of jobs in los angeles fell by a cumulative 9 percent, nearly half again as much as the decrease in national employment."
"in fact, los angeles's peak unemployment rate in 2010 was the highest ever recorded in this city in the almost four decades during which local-area statistics have been published."
"moreover, as of march of this year, employment at the national level had risen by only 3-1/2 million jobs, less than half of the number of jobs lost during the recession, and the unemployment rate was still significantly elevated at 8.2 percent."
"the unemployment rate in the los angeles area has been declining, but, still at almost 12 percent, it remains well above the national average."
"in los angeles, employment expanded by 1 percent over the six months ending in february (the latest available data), and the local-area unemployment rate also declined about 3/4 percentage point."
"the share of unemployed workers who have been without a job for more than six months is still more than 40 percent nationwide, a level well above that seen in earlier recessions."
"being unemployed for such a long time can have negative effects on workers' skills and their attachment to the labor force, thereby possibly reducing the productive capacity of our economy."
"here in los angeles, the issue of workforce skills is all the more concerning because 13 percent of the city's residents are reported to have less than a ninth-grade education, a share of low-education workers that is about twice the national average."
"in addition, households' concerns about their future prospects for employment and income have likely deterred many potential homebuyers from committing to mortgage payments that might be difficult to make if they lose their jobs."
"the san francisco fed also served as a technical resource for an initiative to help street vendors--which comprise 30 percent of the small businesses in the central city area and east los angeles--to access business development services, city certification, and microfinance capital."
"to summarize, the labor market has shown welcome signs of improvement."
"even so, the economy remains far from full employment."
"other labor market indicators have shown similar improvement."
"our economy is recovering from the steepest and most prolonged economic downturn since the 1930s, and these job gains still leave us far short of where we need to be."
"the level of private payrolls remains nearly 5 million below its pre-recession peak, and the unemployment rate stands well above levels that i, and most analysts, judge as normal over the longer run."
"figure 2 illustrates the degree of uncertainty surrounding projections of unemployment."
"first, the fact that the rise in unemployment was quite widespread across industry and occupation groups casts doubt on the hypothesis that there has been an unusually large mismatch between the types of job vacancies and the types of workers available to fill them."
"the beveridge curve plots the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies."
"cyclical variations in aggregate demand tend to move unemployment and job vacancies in opposite directions, whereas structural shifts would be expected to move vacancies and unemployment in the same direction."
"for instance, a structural mismatch between businesses' hiring needs and the skills of unemployed workers would tend to push up the level of vacancies for a given level of unemployment."
"my concern is that individuals with such long unemployment spells could become less employable as their skills deteriorate and as they lose their connections to the labor market."
"for example, the probability of finding a new job has not deteriorated more for individuals experiencing a long-term bout of unemployment relative to those facing shorter spells."
"the measure of job vacancies shown in figure 3 is derived from indexes of help-wanted advertising published by the conference board."
"thus, the assumed increase in unemployment is similar to that experienced in the three deep postâworld war ii recessions."
"it built upon, and incorporated, lessons learned from prior exercises."
"i think it fair to say, for example, that many firms were frustrated by the limitations on how much supervisors would communicate about modeling assumptions and other information relevant to capital planning decisions."
"         i am pleased to participate in the ninth biennial national interagency community reinvestment conference."
"for this reason, community development today is a multidisciplinary exercise that challenges us to think holistically about how housing relates to jobs, educational opportunities, transportation, healthcare, and other services and amenities."
"the federal reserve system currently has an initiative underway to better understand the relationship between community development activities and successful workforce development strategies."
"some jobs, such as construction work, require that workers report to different locations."
"the fund's managers have focused on manufacturing and distribution companies that can create jobs in the state's lower-income communities."
"one of the businesses in the fund's portfolio, primesource food service equipment, moved from an affluent northern dallas suburb to south dallas, where the poverty rate was higher than 40 percent, relocating more than 100 employees and hiring new employees from south dallas."
"i raise this example because it demonstrates what a little imagination can do to solve the problem of connecting people with jobs."
"eastman kodak once employed some 61,000 rochester residents and invested significantly in the city's educational and cultural institutions; three decades later, it employs fewer than 7,000 people and recently filed for bankruptcy protection.7 this is not an uncommon story, except for the fact that rochester managed to gain a net of 90,000 jobs during the three decades of employment decline at kodak."
"how did rochester manage this transition so successfully?"
"together with local government, this network trained entrepreneurs and supported new business ventures, many of which are in optics and photonics."
"through foresight and the collaboration of government, private and nonprofit partners, and committed citizens, rochester was able to build on the kodak legacy, effectively turning lost jobs at kodak into new local opportunities."
"moreover, the stores hire local workers and train them in both the required job skills and in the workplace etiquette necessary to succeed in any job."
"importantly, despite the recent improvement, the job market remains far from normal; for example, the number of people working and total hours worked are still significantly below pre-crisis peaks, while the unemployment rate remains well above what most economists judge to be its long-run sustainable level."
"of particular concern is the large number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months."
"but in addition, because of its negative effects on workers' skills and attachment to the labor force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce the productive capacity of our economy."
"as this audience is well aware, job creation has picked up recently."
"private payroll employment (figure 1) increased by nearly 250,000 jobs per month, on average, in the three months ending in february, and by about 190,000 jobs per month, on average, over the past 12 months."
"together with a lengthening of the average workweek, these employment gains have contributed to a significant increase in aggregate hours worked (figure 2)."
"the increase in hours worked is encouraging, because the decline in hours during the recent recession was extraordinary."
"from the peak of this series in december 2007 to its trough in february 2010, aggregate hours on the job by production workers fell by a remarkable 9-1/2 percent; by comparison, production-worker hours declined by ""only"" 5-3/4  percent during the severe 1981-82 recession."
"the government estimates payroll employment--the number of jobs--from a survey of businesses--the establishment survey."
"a monthly survey of about 60,000 households, which provides the data needed to construct the national unemployment rate, offers an alternative estimate of the number of jobs."
"the positive signs from the labor market have shown through to measures of labor utilization:  after hovering around 9 percent for much of last year, the unemployment rate (figure 4) has moved down since september to 8.3 percent in february, and the share of employment represented by people working part time for economic reasons, an indicator of underutilization, has declined modestly."
"other indicators, such as new claims for unemployment insurance and measures of the breadth of hiring across industries, also point to better labor market conditions."
"notwithstanding these welcome recent signs, the job market remains quite weak relative to historical norms, as i've already noted."
"after nearly two years of job gains, private payroll employment remains more than 5 million jobs below its previous peak; the jobs shortfall is even larger, of course, when increases in the size of the labor force are taken into account."
"and the unemployment rate in february was still roughly 3 percentage points above its average over the 20 years preceding the recession."
"moreover, a significant portion of the improvement in the labor market has reflected a decline in layoffs rather than an increase in hiring."
"it equals the number of hires during the month less the number of separations (including layoffs, quits, and other separations)."
"in any given month, a large number of workers are being hired or are leaving their current jobs, illustrating the dynamism of the u.s. labor market."
"for example, between 2001 and 2007, private employers hired nearly 5 million people, on average, each month."
"taking the difference between gross hires and separations, the net monthly change in payrolls during this period was, on average, less than 100,000 jobs per month--a small figure compared to the gross flows."
"as figure 7 shows, the declines in aggregate payrolls during the recession stemmed from both a reduction in hiring and a large increase in layoffs."
"a story centered on potential workers dropping out of the labor force might seem in line with the low level of the labor force participation rate (figure 9)."
"recent improvements are encouraging, but, as i have noted, in an absolute sense, the job market is still far from normal by many measures, and millions of families continue to suffer the day-to-day hardships associated with not being able to find suitable employment."
"those who have experienced unemployment know the burdens that it creates, and a growing academic literature documents some dimensions of those burdens."
"for example, research has shown that workers who lose previously stable jobs experience sharp declines in earnings that may last for many years, even after they find new work.2   surveys indicate that more than one-half of the households experiencing long unemployment spells since the onset of the recent recession withdrew money from savings and retirement accounts to cover expenses, one-half borrowed money from family and friends, and one-third struggled to meet housing expenses.3  unemployment also takes a toll on people's health and may have long-term consequences for the families of the unemployed as well."
"for example, studies suggest that unemployed people suffer from a higher incidence of stressârelated health problems such as depression, stroke, and heart disease, and they may have a lower life expectancy.4   the children of the unemployed achieve less in school and appear to have reduced long-term earnings prospects.5           in addition, unemployment--especially long-term unemployment--imposes important economic costs on everyone, not just the unemployed themselves."
"elevated unemployment strains public finances because of both lost tax revenue and the payment of increased unemployment benefits and other income support to affected families."
"people unemployed for a long time have historically found jobs less easily than those experiencing shorter spells of unemployment, perhaps because their skills erode, they lose relationships within the workforce, or they acquire a stigma that deters firms from hiring them."
"for example, because an older worker who loses a job typically takes longer to find a new job than does a younger worker in the same situation, the aging of the baby boom generation has probably contributed to a gradual rise in long-term unemployment."
"factors such as globalization, technological change, and the loss of lower-skill manufacturing jobs have likely reduced the employability and earnings potential of some groups of workers."
"in contrast, over that same period, only about one-sixth of those already unemployed for more than 27 weeks managed to find a job within a month."
"similarly, the fact that labor demand appears weak in most industries and locations is suggestive of a general shortfall of aggregate demand rather a worsening mismatch of skills and jobs."
"an empirical relationship that economists have long used to interpret developments in the labor market is known as the beveridge curve (figure 14)."
"that curve--named after the british economist william beveridge--compares unemployment (the number of workers looking for employers) to job vacancies (the number of workers that employers are seeking)."
"in good times, when the unemployment rate is low, businesses are growing and workers are harder to find, so job vacancies tend to be high."
"on the usual interpretation, a recession is a period in which the economy is moving down along the beveridge curve; as output and the demand for labor fall, job vacancies decline and unemployment rises."
"for example, suppose that, because of changes in technology or in the mix of industries and jobs, the mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the needs of employers worsens."
"then, for a given number of job openings, the number of the unemployed who are qualified for those jobs is smaller and the unemployment rate is higher than it would have been before the mismatch problem worsened."
"another possible explanation for a temporary shift in the beveridge curve is extended and emergency unemployment insurance, which induces unemployed workers who might otherwise consider leaving the labor force to continue searching for work."
"or employers may be more selective in hiring when their need for workers is not pressing and take more time to fill vacancies in an effort to find especially qualified hires."
"still, conditions remain far from normal, as shown, for example, by the high level of long-term unemployment and the fact that jobs and hours worked remain well below pre-crisis peaks, even without adjusting for growth in the labor force."
"if structural factors are the predominant explanation for the increase in long-term unemployment, it will become even more important to take the steps needed to ensure that workers are able to obtain the skills needed to meet the demands of our rapidly changing economy."
"the broader measure of labor underutilization referenced here is the u-5 measure of unemployment, constructed by the bureau of labor statistics."

"as i described in a speech last month, globalization and technological change have continued to shift the occupations and industrial distribution of new jobs available."
"these currents of globalization and technological change continue on their path, making it more likely that workers who were laid off during the recession would be unable to find reemployment that is of comparable quality to their previous jobs.1 about two-thirds of all job losses in the recession were in middle-wage occupations--such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration jobs--but these occupations have accounted for less than one-fourth of the job growth during the recovery.2 by contrast, lower-wage occupations, such as retail sales, food service, and other lower-paying service jobs, accounted for only one-fifth of job losses during the recession but more than one-half of total job gains during the recovery."
"moreover, as you all know, the temporary payroll tax cut has now expired, and many households have seen their disposable incomes reduced for this reason as well."

"this speech expands on remarks i made in march to the national community reinvestment coalition, in which i explored the roles that monetary and bank regulatory policy play in reducing the unemployment, economic marginalization, and financial vulnerability of millions of moderate- and low-income working americans."
"to make matters worse, there is also some evidence to suggest that the factors that contributed to the rise in inequality and the stagnation of wages in the bottom half of the income distribution, such as technological change that favors those with a college education and globalization, are still at play in the recovery--and perhaps may have accelerated.11 about two-thirds of all job losses in the recession were in middle-wage occupations--such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration jobs--but these occupations have accounted for less than one-fourth of subsequent job growth.12 in contrast, the decline in lower-wage occupations--such as retail sales, food service, and other lower-paying service jobs--accounted for only one-fifth of job loss and more than one-half of total job gains in the recovery.13           it is not only the occupational and industrial distribution of the new jobs that poses challenges for workers and their families struggling to make ends meet, but also the fact that many of the jobs that have returned are part time or make use of temporary arrangements popularly known as contingent work."
"the flexibility of these jobs may be beneficial for workers who want or need time to address their family needs."
"however, workers in these jobs often receive less pay and fewer benefits than traditional full-time or ""permanent"" workers, are much less likely to benefit from the protections of labor and employment laws, and often have no real pathway to upward mobility in the workplace.14           wage gains have remained more muted than is typical during a recovery."
"while this phenomenon likely partly reflects the trends in job creation that i have already discussed, weak wage growth also reflects the severe nature of the crisis: typically, those who are laid off during recessions struggle to find reemployment that is of comparable quality to their previous job, and research has shown that, on average, a person's income remains depressed for decades following job loss, and that income losses over one's working life are especially severe when the job loss occurs during a recession.15           indeed, while average wages have continued to increase (albeit slowly) on an annual basis for persons who have remained employed, the average wage for new hires has declined since 2010.16 although it is too early to state with certainty what the long-term effect of this recession will be on the earnings potential of those who lost their jobs, given the severity of the job loss and sluggishness of the recovery--with nearly 9 million jobs lost and still almost 2-1/2 million jobs below pre-recession employment levels--it is very likely that, for many households, future labor earnings will be well below what they had anticipated in the years before the recession."

"in my remarks, i will start by discussing the types of jobs being generated in the current recovery."
"challenges posed by labor market conditions        the great recession stands out for the magnitude of job losses we experienced throughout the downturn."
"moreover, the government's current estimate of 12 million unemployed does not include nearly a million discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work and 8 million people who say that they are working part time even though they would prefer a full-time job."
"a broader measure of underemployment that includes these and other potential workers stands at 14.3 percent."
"about two-thirds of all job losses resulting from the recession were in moderate-wage occupations, such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office administration jobs."
"however, these occupations have accounted for less than one-quarter of subsequent job gains."
"the declines in lower-wage occupations--such as retail sales and food service--accounted for about one-fifth of job loss, but a bit more than one-half of subsequent job gains."
"indeed, recent job gains have been largely concentrated in lower-wage occupations such as retail sales, food preparation, manual labor, home health care, and customer service.3           furthermore, wage growth has remained more muted than is typical during an economic recovery."
"the slow rebound also reflects the severe nature of the crisis, as the slow wage growth especially affects those workers who have become recently re-employed following long spells of unemployment."
"in fact, while average wages have continued to increase steadily for persons who have remained employed all along, the average wage for new hires have actually declined since 2010.4           the faces of low-wage americans are diverse."
"they include people of varying employment status, race, gender, immigration status, and other characteristics."
"many such americans are attached to the workforce and are deeply committed to both personal success and to making a contribution to society."
"for purposes of reference, in 2011, low wage was defined as $23,005 per year or $11.06 per hour.5           today, about one-quarter of all workers are considered ""low wage."""
"this diverse group of workers faces numerous barriers when trying to access the labor market or advance in their current positions."
"over the course of a year, reserve banks across the country hosted a series of 32 regional discussions aimed at examining the complex factors creating chronic unemployment conditions and identifying promising workforce development solutions.6 the kinds of problems faced by low-wage workers are familiar to all of you and have long been part of the structural conditions of poverty and near-poverty in america."
"we know, for example, that location presents thorny challenges for many low-wage workers."
"within metropolitan areas, jobs are not spread out evenly and job creation tends to be depressed in low-income communities."
"as a result, many low-wage workers face long commutes and serious commuting difficulties due to less reliable transportation and an inadequate transportation infrastructure."
"moreover, a number of low-wage employees work non-standard hours, exacerbating both transportation and childcare issues, as well as personal health problems.7           traditionally, many workers find jobs through social networks and through personal connections that they have to the labor market."
"addressing these challenges        among those responding to these challenges are innovative local practitioners who are implementing programs designed to expand job opportunities for low-wage workers."
"consider impact services in philadelphia, an organization that builds relationships with the local business community to better understand their hiring needs and then devises programs that supply those firms with appropriately skilled workers from the community.8 the national fund for workforce solutions is another example."
"but the 21st century labor market is increasingly complex; it continues to generate new challenges."
"for example, growth in sectors such as green industries and advanced manufacturing is creating jobs, but these jobs may demand different skills."
"access to reliable information becomes critical for workers who are considering a new job, and must carefully weigh the skills and credentials required by potential employers with the cost of training and the likelihood of gaining employment."
"and, as demand for more credentials increases, workers who lack those credentials will find it increasingly difficult to gain upward mobility in the job market."
"contingent work        many employers are looking to make the employment relationship more flexible, and so are increasingly relying on part-time work and a variety of arrangements popularly known as ""contingent work."""
"for example, while temporary work accounted for 10 percent of job losses during the recession, these jobs have accounted for more than 25 percent of net employment gains since the reces­sion ended.10 in fact, tempo­rary help is rapidly approaching a new record, and businesses' use of staffing services continues to increase.11           contingent employment is arguably a sensible response to today's competitive marketplace."
"the flexibility may be beneficial for workers who want or need time to address their family needs."
"however, workers in these jobs often receive less pay and fewer benefits than traditional full-time or ""permanent"" workers, are much less likely to benefit from the protections of labor and employment laws, and often have no real pathway to upward mobility in the workplace.12           many workers who hold contingent positions do so involuntarily."
"department of labor statistics tell us that 8 million americans say they are working part-time jobs but would like full-time jobs.13 these are the people in our communities who are ""part time by necessity."""
"as businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-time, temporary, and seasonal positions, workers today bear far more of the responsibility and risk for managing their careers and financial security."
"indeed, the expansion of contingent work has contributed to the increasing gap between high- and low-wage workers and to the increasing sense of insecurity among workers.14           flexible and part-time arrangements can present great opportunities to some workers, but the substantial increase in part-time workers does raise a number of concerns."
"part-time workers are particularly vulnerable to personal shocks due to lower levels of compensation, the absence of meaningful benefits, and even a lack of paid sick or personal days."
"not surprisingly, turnover is high in these part-time jobs."
"access to credit        the economic marginalization that comes with the growth of part-time and low-paying jobs is exacerbated by inadequate access to credit for many working americans."
"working americans have several core financial needs."
"our country cannot achieve prosperity without addressing the powerful undertow created by flat wages and tenuous financial security for so many millions of americans."
"nonetheless, and again, the millions of people who would prefer to work full time can find only part-time work."
"that said, the existing mandate regarding maximum employment requires policymakers on the federal open market committee (fomc) to understand labor market dynamics, which obviously must include an understanding of low- and moderate-income workers."
"the hitachi foundation recently set out to answer this question by identifying firms that provided upward job mobility for their employees."
"they found that the identified employers showed noteworthy consistency in how they train and educate workers, develop career ladders, and craft supportive human resources policies and other motivators."
"these institutions have the potential to generate local jobs through targeted procurement purchases of food, energy, supplies, and services from local businesses."
"20           the evergreen cooperative in cleveland, ohio, is an example of a network of worker-owned businesses, launched in low-income neighborhoods, to support local anchor institutions."
"this model is effective because it capitalizes on local production, and because it forges a local business development strategy that effectively meets many of the anchor institutions' own needs.21    role for community-based organizations        clearly, the challenges facing low-wage workers are multi-faceted and complex."
"you are the ideal audience for this message because you know how to link federal policymaking with economic empowerment."
"ncrc has grown to an association of more than 600 community-based organizations that promote access to basic banking services to create and sustain affordable housing, jobs, and vibrant communities for america's working families."
"community-based organizations like many of those represented in this room will need to consider how to work with low-wage workers to bridge information gaps by expanding workers' networks, providing legitimate information, and identifying new job opportunities."
"the unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma is 11.2 percent."
"among workers age 16 to 19, the unemployment rate is 25.1 percent."

"while the common perception may be that businesses do not invest in employee training, a survey by the american society for training and development indicated that employers committed $172 billion in 2011 to employee training."
"this investment, however, traditionally funds the highest-educated and highest-paid employees."
"the hitachi foundation has suggested that considering a reallocation of even a small portion of these funds toward frontline workers would offer benefits to both employers and employees."
"as an example of these employer practices, right here in our backyard, the community foundation for the national capital region piloted the ""career navigators"" program with three hospitals in maryland's montgomery county and one in the district of columbia to help employees navigate a pathway to better jobs with their current employer."
"these hospitals concluded that investing in training and education for top-performing, entry-level staffers in positions such as housekeeping, food service, and patient transport could provide a pipeline for the skilled employees that the hospitals would rely upon in the future."
"employees receive support with literacy and college-readiness training, career coaching, and scholarships."

"with economic activity constrained by fiscal consolidation, the lingering effects from the financial crisis, and the added headwinds of europe's recession and debt problems, most fomc participants reported in december that they expected only a gradual decline in unemployment over the next two years, to about 7 percent by the end of 2014.4           the official estimate of 12 million currently unemployed does not include 800,000 more discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work.5  in addition, nearly 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working part time even though they would prefer full-time jobs."
"a broader measure of underemployment that includes these and others who want a job stands at 14.4 percent, nearly double the 7.9 percent ""headline"" rate that is most commonly reported in the media.6           the large shortfall of employment relative to its maximum level has imposed huge burdens on all too many american households and represents a substantial social cost."
"the long-term unemployed can see their skills erode, making these workers less attractive to employers."
"if these jobless workers were to become less employable, the natural rate of unemployment might rise or, to the extent that they leave the labor force, we could see a persistently lower rate of labor force participation."
"a decline in the unemployment rate could, for example, primarily reflect the exit from the labor force of discouraged job seekers."
"federal reserve research concludes that the unemployment rate is probably the best single indicator of current labor market conditions."
"as i noted before, the unemployment rate may decline for reasons other than improved labor demand, such as when workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force."
"the payroll employment data, however, also have shortcomings."
"in addition, i am likely to supplement the data on employment and unemployment with measures of gross job flows, such as job loss and hiring, which describe the underlying dynamics of the labor market."

"the 1977 law spelling out that responsibility also assigned the goal of stable prices, and we call this combination of objectives the federal reserve's dual mandate.2           with so many people today unable to find work, it might seem odd to highlight such an ambitious and distant goal for employment."
"i do so because the gulf between maximum employment and the very difficult conditions workers face today helps explain the urgency behind the federal reserve's ongoing efforts to strengthen the recovery."
"but the implications of this result may seem a little abstract, so let me illustrate the same idea in a way that tries to show the burden that workers continue to bear in this slow recovery."
"for example, in the 1970s, the pool of potential workers was expanding as baby boomers and an increasing share of women moved into the labor force, such that employment needed to rise relatively quickly just to absorb these additional workers."
"government spending on unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs rises in recessions, helping individuals hurt by the downturn and also supporting consumer spending and the broader economy by replacing lost income."
"residential investment creates jobs in construction and related industries."
"after a lengthy recession that imposed great hardships on american workers, the weak recovery has made the past five years the toughest that many of today's workers have ever experienced."
"moreover, the government's current estimate of 12 million unemployed doesn't include 800,000 discouraged workers who say they have given up looking for work."
"and, as exhibit 6 shows, 8 million people, or 5.6 percent of the workforce, say they are working part time even though they would prefer a full-time job."
"a broader measure of underemployment that includes these and other potential workers stands at 14.4 percent."
"compared with the 7.9 percent unemployment rate for all workers, the unemployment rate for african americans is 13.8 percent."
"among african americans in that age group, 38 percent of those in the labor force can't find a job."
"at its worst point in the 1980s, the median length of unemployment for those looking for a job was 12 weeks, but the median since the great recession has averaged 20 weeks and now stands at 16 weeks."
"three million americans have been looking for work for one year or more; that's one-fourth of all unemployed workers, which is down from 2011's peak but far larger than was seen before the great recession."
"when you're unemployed for six months or a year, it is hard to qualify for a lease, so even the option of relocating to find a job is often off the table."
"the toll is simply terrible on the mental and physical health of workers, on their marriages, and on their children.10           long-term unemployment is also a great concern because it has the potential to itself become a headwind restraining the economy."
"individuals out of work for an extended period can become less employable as they lose the specific skills acquired in their previous jobs and also lose the habits needed to hold down any job."
"those out of work for a long time also tend to lose touch with former coâworkers in their previous industry or occupation--contacts that can often help an unemployed worker find a job."
"long-term unemployment can make any worker progressively less employable, even after the economy strengthens."
"a factor contributing to the high level of long-term unemployment in the current recovery is the relatively large proportion of workers who have permanently lost their previous jobs, as opposed to being laid off temporarily."
"in general, individuals who permanently lose their previous jobs take longer to become reemployed than do those on temporary layoff, are more likely to have to change industries or occupations to find a new job, and earn significantly less when they become reemployed.11           the greater amount of permanent job loss seen in the recent recession also suggests that there might have been an increase in the degree of mismatch between the skills possessed by the unemployed and those demanded by employers."
"for example, the rise in unemployment during the recession was accompanied by a dramatic decline in job vacancies and was widespread across industry and occupation groups."
"moreover, if skills mismatch in the labor market has led to an excess supply of workers in some sectors and a shortage of workers in others, then we would expect to see an atypical amount of variation in the balance between job openings and unemployment across sectors."
"in addition, widespread mismatch between job vacancies and workers across different sectors might be expected to cause wage rates to rise relatively quickly in sectors with many job openings and relatively slowly in sectors with an excess supply of available workers."
"more can and should be done to help dislocated workers acquire new skills to transition from industries and occupations with fewer opportunities."
"the job market is improving."
"my colleagues and i at the federal reserve are well aware of the difficulties faced by workers in this slow recovery, and we're actively engaged in continuing efforts to promote a stronger economy, more jobs, and better conditions for all workers."

"overall, community bankers that were part of the pilot expressed strong support for this approach, which reduced the time examiners needed to spend on-site at bank offices."
"more generally, the federal reserve has invested substantial resources in developing technological tools for examiners to improve the efficiency of both off-site and on-site supervisory activities."
"conclusion        as i noted in my speech six months ago, the old unitary approach to prudential oversight has in practical terms been supplanted by various statutory, regulatory, and supervisory measures, particularly since the financial crisis."
"for instance, at a comparable point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by about 800,000 workers; in contrast, in the current recovery, government employment has declined by about 650,000 jobs."
"at the board, our office of diversity and inclusion coordinates this effort, but everyone involved in the recruiting, hiring, management, and promotion of economists is engaged in it as well."
"the interactions between supervisors and firms on these matters are extensive, focused, and consequential."
"assuming that they are able to discern factors that generally explain patterns of hiring, raises, promotions, demotions, and dismissals, employees receive very strong signals as to what those running the organization actually value."
"but we can, and do, require dismissal of employees as part of our enforcement actions against firms."
"indeed, some variation in outcomes arguably contributes to economic growth because it creates incentives to work hard, get an education, save, invest, and undertake risk."
"research shows that, for a variety of reasons, including inequality in teacher pay, the best teachers tend to migrate to and concentrate in schools in higher-income areas.30 even within districts and in individual schools, where teacher pay is often uniform based on experience, factors beyond pay tend to lead more experienced and better-performing teachers to migrate to schools and to classrooms with more-advantaged students.31  higher education that families can afford for many individuals and families, higher education is the other cornerstone of economic opportunity."
"the premium in lifetime earnings because of higher education has increased over the past few decades, reflecting greater demand for college-educated workers."
"by one measure, the median annual earnings of full-time workers with a four-year bachelor's degree are 79 percent higher than the median for those with only a high school diploma.32 the wage premium for a graduate degree is significantly higher than the premium for a college degree."

"job gains in 2014 have averaged 230,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two years."
"estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the magnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables, including labor force participation, the extent of part-time employment for economic reasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits."
"for policymakers, the key question is: what portion of the decline in labor force participation reflects structural shifts and what portion reflects cyclical weakness in the labor market?"
"labor force participation peaked in early 2000, so its decline began well before the great recession."
"as an accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to increases in four factors: retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, including worker discouragement.8 of these, greater worker discouragement is most directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the workforce."
"indeed, the flattening out of the labor force participation rate since late last year could partly reflect discouraged workers rejoining the labor force in response to the significant improvements that we have seen in labor market conditions."
"if so, retirements might contribute less to declining participation in the period ahead than would otherwise be expected based on the aging workforce.11           a second factor bearing on estimates of labor market slack is the elevated number of workers who are employed part time but desire full-time work (those classified as ""part time for economic reasons"")."
"at nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of such workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typical historically, providing another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate may understate the amount of remaining slack in the labor market."
"for example, the ongoing shift in employment away from goods production and toward services, a sector which historically has used a greater portion of part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs."
"likewise, the continuing decline of middle-skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part-time jobs, may raise the share of part-time jobs in overall employment.12 despite these challenges in assessing where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in the long run, the sharp run-up in involuntary part-time employment during the recession and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant."
"for example, the quits rate has tended to be pro-cyclical, since more workers voluntarily quit their jobs when they are more confident about their ability to find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires."
"a significant increase in job openings over the past year suggests notable improvement in labor market conditions, but the hiring rate has only partially recovered from its decline during the recession."
"given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls."
"alternatively, subdued hiring could indicate that firms are encountering difficulties in finding qualified job applicants."
"following this methodology, federal reserve board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor market indicators, including four i just discussed.14 this broadly based metric supports the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions."
"and, since wage movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate."
"to the extent that firms faced limits in reducing real and nominal wages when the labor market was exceptionally weak, they may find that now they do not need to raise wages to attract qualified workers."
"nevertheless, the committee judged that underutilization of labor resources still remains significant."

"looking at the aggregate production function, we begin with labor supply."
"many of those who dropped out of the labor force may be discouraged workers."
"further strengthening of the economy will likely pull some of these workers back into the labor market, although skills and networks may have depreciated some over the past years."
"globally, however, there is tremendous scope for productivity gains reflecting technological catch up, infrastructure investment, and the potential for human capital increases due to improvements in education and nutrition, and the incorporation and inclusion of women into the labor force."

"ben bernanke's intelligence and knowledge served him well as chairman."
"crucial to this process, as i just mentioned, is job creation."
"the federal reserve tries to promote the conditions to foster job creation, but, overwhelmingly, it is businesses that create the jobs."
"about 85 percent of nonfarm employment is in the private sector, which traditionally is the source of a similarly large share of new jobs during economic expansions."
"so far during this expansion, public-sector employment has declined and the private sector has accounted for all of the net increase in employment, so businesses have been even more crucial to job creation than usual."
"according to the latest data from the labor department, a little more than half of the net number of jobs created since employment began growing in 2010 has been generated by firms with fewer than 250 employees, and most of that amount was accounted for by firms with fewer than 50 employees.1               one of the reasons i wanted so much to be here this evening was to be able to acknowledge these important contributions."
"i am honored to be addressing the owners of 53 small businesses whose excellence exemplifies the enormous contributions that millions of small businesses collectively make to our economy."

"furthermore, we are exploring ways that our community bank examiners may be able to complete more examination work off site."
"more than 8 million jobs have been added to nonfarm payrolls since 2009, almost the same number lost as a result of the recession."
"broader measures of unemployment that include workers marginally attached to the labor force and those working part time for economic reasons have fallen a bit more than the headline unemployment rate, and labor force participation, which had been falling, has ticked up this year."
"for example, the share of the workforce that is working part time but would prefer to work full time remains quite high by historical standards."
"similarly, while the share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have been looking for work for more than six months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it remains as high as any time prior to the great recession.5 there is ongoing debate about why long-term unemployment remains so high and the degree to which it might decline in a more robust economy."
"as i argued more fully in a recent speech, i believe that long-term unemployment might fall appreciably if economic conditions were stronger.6           the low level of labor force participation may also signal additional slack that is not reflected in the headline unemployment rate."
"although economists differ over what share of those currently outside the labor market might join or rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy, my own view is that some portion of the decline in participation likely represents labor market slack.7           lastly, economists also look to wage pressures to signal a tightening labor market."
"the records for long-term unemployed begin in 1948."
"see janet l. yellen (2014), ""what the federal reserve is doing to promote a stronger job market,"" speech delivered at the 2014 national interagency community reinvestment conference, chicago, march 31."
"historically, the u.s. labor market has been characterized by substantial geographic mobility."
"""5 to give a sense of the magnitude of this process, while net job gains and losses are typically measured in the hundreds of thousands each calendar quarter, gross job creation and destruction commonly run at a pace of roughly 7 million jobs each quarter."
"creative destruction has been shown to improve productivity as jobs that have low productivity are replaced with jobs that yield greater productivity.6  however, a variety of data indicate that this feature of labor market dynamism has diminished."
"since the 1980s, internal migration in the united states over both long and short distances has declined."
"for many employers and workers, the internet has reduced the cost of posting job openings and the cost of searching for jobs."
"for instance, an increase in the costs to firms of hiring and firing individuals or an increase in the costs to individuals of changing jobs could lead to fewer productivity-enhancing job changes."
"moreover, the number of individuals working at such firms stands almost 2 million below its peak in 1999."
"given the role of innovation by entrepreneurs and the well-documented importance of successful young firms in creating jobs, these trends are disheartening."
"the polarization of the labor income distribution has been mirrored in the types of jobs we are creating."
"since the 1990s, job gains have been concentrated at the upper and lower ends of the earnings distribution."
"there have been healthy gains in employment in highly paid occupations, such as computer and information systems managers, and a rise in low-paid jobs, such as home health-care workers, but growth has been much slower in occupations with earnings in the middle of the distribution, such as machinists."
"for example, food services, retail, and employment services, all low-wage industries, accounted for nearly 45 percent of net employment growth from the start of the recovery through early 2012, while employment in a number of industries that offer good jobs for mid-wage workers--including construction, manufacturing, and finance, insurance, and real estate--did not grow in those years or grew too slowly to make up for their job losses during the recession.11  there is no single explanation for the rise in inequality and the decline in the share of jobs that provide a middle-class standard of living."
"and, as is nearly always the case, labor shortages in discrete skilled job categories may be placing some upward pressures on wages for those jobs (though, judging by such aggregate data as we have, not by as much as one might have thought based on the widespread anecdotal reports of skilled labor shortages)."
"for instance, early childhood education can increase the educational attainment of children from low-income families as well as improve other outcomes.16 in addition, recent innovations in job training programs, which more tightly link the training to the needs of employers in sectors of the economy with a demand for workers, have been shown to increase both the employment and wages of participants.17  investment in basic research by the federal government is another area in which greater investments could yield significant returns and in which a public policy role is warranted because of externalities."
"conclusion the longer-term challenges to the american economy that i have identified this evening are real."

"we are trying to make it cheaper for businesses to build, expand, and hire."
"since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in october 2009, the economy has added more than 7-1/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 3 percentage points to 6.7 percent."
"chicago, as you all know, was hit harder than many areas during the recession and remains a tougher market for workers."
"metro chicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide.1           but while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy and the job market are not back to normal health."
"it certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older workers who lost long-term jobs, and to african americans, who are facing a job market today that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the great recession."
"in some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession."
"the numbers of people who have been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a year are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago."
"we know that the long-term unemployed face big challenges."
"research shows employers are less willing to hire the long-term unemployed and often prefer other job candidates with less or even no relevant experience.3           that is what dorine poole learned, after she lost her job processing medical insurance claims, just as the recession was getting started."
"like many others, she could not find any job, despite clerical skills and experience acquired over 15 years of steady employment."
"when employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became a disqualification."
"even those needing her skills and experience preferred less qualified workers without a long spell of unemployment."
"for dorine and others, we know that workers displaced by layoffs and plant closures who manage to find work suffer long-lasting and often permanent wage reductions.4 jermaine brownlee was an apprentice plumber and skilled construction worker when the recession hit, and he saw his wages drop sharply as he scrambled for odd jobs and temporary work."

"vicki lira lost her full-time job of 20 years when the printing plant she worked in shut down in 2006."

"the unemployment rate is down, but not included in that rate are more than seven million people who are working part time but want a full-time job."
"as a share of the workforce, that number is very high historically."
"slack means that there are significantly more people willing and capable of filling a job than there are jobs for them to fill."
"during a period of little or no slack, there still may be vacant jobs and people who want to work, but a large share of those willing to work lack the skills or are otherwise not well suited for the jobs that are available."
"one important reason relates to the skills and education of people in the workforce."
"many of you in this audience are helping workers address this challenge, but you also know that the economy continues to change very rapidly."
"to the extent that people who desire to work lack the skills that employers are demanding, there is less slack in the labor market."
"even understanding what workers need to appeal to employers is difficult in a fast-changing economy."
"for government, effective solutions for structural unemployment, beginning with improved education, tend to be expensive and take a long time to work."
"if unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the jobs available, then the federal reserve's efforts to create jobs would not be very effective."
"this is not just an academic debate."
"one form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the unemployment rate or payrolls, some of which i have touched on already."
"for example, the seven million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job."
"this number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past experience, and the existence of such a large pool of ""partly unemployed"" workers is a sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate."
"statistics on job turnover also point to considerable slack in the labor market."
"although firms are now laying off fewer workers, they have been reluctant to increase the pace of hiring."
"likewise, the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs is noticeably below levels before the recession; that is an indicator that people are reluctant to risk leaving their jobs because they worry that it will be hard to find another."
"a third form of evidence related to slack concerns the characteristics of the extraordinarily large share of the unemployed who have been out of work for six months or more."
"these workers find it exceptionally hard to find steady, regular work, and they appear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to find a job."
"the concern is that the long-term unemployed may remain on the sidelines, ultimately dropping out of the workforce."
"but the data suggest that the long-term unemployed look basically the same as other unemployed people in terms of their occupations, educational attainment, and other characteristics."
"and, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the short-term jobless do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally improved for both groups."
"that is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-term unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term unemployed."
"participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a job give up trying to find one."
"when the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age population was part of the labor force."
"but some ""retirements"" are not voluntary, and some of these workers may rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy."

"at that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of fomc participants' most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.1 the economy has created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession."
"most recently, after a couple months of relatively modest payroll growth, employers added an estimated 271,000 jobs in october."
"despite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the labor market has reached full employment."
"to begin with, i believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as out of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market."
"to be classified as unemployed, working-age people must report that they have actively sought work within the past four weeks."
"most of those not seeking work are appropriately not counted as unemployed."
"these include most retirees, teenagers and young adults in school, and those staying home to care for children and other dependent family members."
"even in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not to work."
"but some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced to seek work if the likelihood of finding a job rose or if the expected pay was higher."
"examples here include people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects for employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended."
"in october, almost 2 million individuals classified as outside the labor force because they had not searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were available for work."
"this is a considerable number of people, and some of them undoubtedly would be drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to strengthen."
"likewise, some of those who report they don't want to work now could change their minds in a stronger job market."
"another margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate consists of individuals who report that they are working part time but would prefer a full-time job and cannot find one--those classified as ""part time for economic reasons."""
"the share of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the great recession to around 6-1/2 percent by 2010."
"since then, however, the share of these part time workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed."
"while this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that over time may have increased the prevalence of part-time employment, i think some room remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves further."
"the pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator, albeit an imperfect one, of the degree of labor market slack."
"more recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business sector."
"foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in u.s. exports, and the u.s. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last year, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper."
"job growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers with more to spend on other goods and services."
"the staff who worked on the october 15 report did a great job, but it took a mammoth effort on their part to gather detailed trade data for just that single day."

"in 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, the federal government created an agency with the mission of providing detailed and objective information on american workers."
"that task fell to carroll wright, who had won the confidence of workers and management as chief of the massachusetts bureau of labor statistics in the years after that state became the first to legalize labor unions."
"at that point, before the united states itself had recognized such rights and before the federal government could agree on labor standards, the public needed an unimpeachable assessment of the conditions faced by workers."
"under carroll wright, what was then called the bureau of labor investigated major labor disputes and issued reports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action and legislation."
"the respect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that wright oversaw led to the dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and later raised public awareness about the deplorable conditions faced by women in the workplace."
"carroll wright recognized that this simple, powerful idea could help build public confidence for the government's effort to reduce conflicts between management and workers and move our nation forward."
"to supplement the traditional measurement of productivity as output per hour of labor, she oversaw the creation of a new measure of multifactor productivity in the private sector, estimating productivity as the result of both labor and capital inputs."
"from 1979, when she was appointed by president carter, to 1991, when she retired, the news on employment, productivity, and inflation was often bad."
"after government service, janet had a long and active retirement in which she continued her contributions to the economic profession and the science of statistics."
"the bureau of labor statistics is exceptional, and in that way, i hope it serves as an example of how effective, reliable, and trusted government can be."
"many types of financial firms are represented here today, with diverse roles within treasury markets."
"most notably, the labor market has continued to improve this year, pushing the economy closer to full employment."
"alternative broader gauges of unemployment--which include individuals who are marginally attached to the labor force and employees working part-time for economic reasons--have also shown steady improvement this year."
"although the unemployment rate is near longer-run norms, other measures of labor utilization are not."
"the labor force participation rate remains materially below the pre-recession trend, even after adjusting for demographics.2 and the share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains a full percentage point above the pre-recession level of around 3 percent, despite considerable recent improvement."
"the fact that wages have not accelerated is significant, but more so as an indicator that labor market slack is still present and that workers' bargaining power likely remains weak."
"""why is involuntary part-time work elevated?"""
"""involuntary part-time work: here to stay? """
"if workers combine two or more part-time jobs to arrive at a full-time workweek, part-time employment could be elevated with average weekly hours at normal levels."
"but the logistical costs of multiple job holding make such an outcome unlikely, and in recent years elevated part-time employment has not coincided with an increase in official estimates of multiple job holding."
"the labor force participation rate remains below most estimates of its underlying trend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer to work full time."

"i am grateful to michael kiley of the fed for this insight."
"more than three-fourths of american businesses have fewer than 10 employees and another nearly one-fourth have between 10 and 500 employees.1 in addition to constituting the vast majority of firms in the united states, small businesses account for about one-half of private-sector employment.2 and small firms, especially new small firms, are an even greater source of net new jobs in our economy.3 thus, ensuring that creditworthy small businesses have access to credit is vitally important."
"small businesses include plumbers and electricians, medical and dental offices, dry cleaners and hair salons, restaurants and bodegas, as well as growth-oriented tech start-ups and small manufacturers."
"""who creates jobs?"
"my fellow board members and i know that community banks provide essential financial services to households, small businesses, and farms in communities throughout the country."
"we know that community banks serve many customers that large banks do not and provide services that are not offered by large banks in many communities."
"the significant improvement in the economy since then has helped communities and community banks, but i am well aware that the challenges for this sector continue, and my board colleagues understand this also."
"we know and appreciate these concerns because the board makes it our business to regularly and extensively meet with and talk to community bankers and industry leaders."
"in this role, i was responsible for the supervision of a substantial number of community banking organizations in the nine states of the 12th district."
"generally, market actors with actual or contemplated claims on a nonfinancial corporation are left to their own devices in protecting their interests, though various features of contract, securities, and insolvency law are designed to help them make these judgments more efficiently."
"the first example arises from the fact that, by the very nature of their business, many intermediaries have substantially more customer-facing liabilities1 on their balance sheets than nonfinancial firms."
"although other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how much slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away from full employment."
"although the unemployment rate may now be close to its longer-run normal level--which most fomc participants now estimate is around 4.9 percent--this traditional metric of resource utilization almost certainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists: on a cyclically adjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying trend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer full-time employment.32 consistent with this assessment is the slow pace at which hourly wages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it relatively easy to hire and retain employees."
"for example, attracting discouraged workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful employment opportunities and strong hiring."
"similarly, firms may be unwilling to restructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater difficulty filling part-time positions."
"moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run ""natural"" rate of unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change over time, and can only be estimated imprecisely."
"for various reasons, however, employers often try to avoid nominal wage cuts."
"(bewley (1999) suggests a number of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have on employee morale."
"this measure of core import prices is constructed by board staff using published and unpublished data provided by the bureau of economic analysis and the bureau of labor statistics."
"from may through july, non-farm payroll employment gains have averaged 235,000 per month."
"we are interested also in aspects of the labor market beyond the simple u-3 measure of unemployment, including for example the rates of unemployment of older workers and of those working part-time for economic reasons; we are interested also in the participation rate."
"while thinking of different aspects of unemployment, we are concerned mainly with trying to find the right measure of the difficulties caused to current and potential participants in the labor force by their unemployment."

"communicating with the public is an important part of my job."
"one of the hardest-hit industries was manufacturing, which, as you well know, is important to ohio."
"the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent nationally, and it reached 11 percent here in ohio."
"u.s. nonfarm payrolls shrank by 8-1/2 million jobs during 2008 and 2009, or about 6 percent of the national workforce."
"over that same period, ohio lost more than 400,000 jobs, or 7-1/2 percent of the state's employment."
"the u.s. economy has created 12 million jobs since the labor market's low point, and total nonfarm payrolls are now 3-1/2 million greater than just prior to the recession."
"ohio's unemployment rate has declined even more during the recovery than the nation as a whole, and at 5.2 percent in may, it was somewhat below the u.s. average in that month."
"nevertheless, although nonfarm payrolls in ohio have increased by around 400,000 jobs since the low point for the state's employment, payrolls have yet to surpass their level just prior to the recession."
"manufacturing is important to ohio, and people here are keenly aware of the challenges that american manufacturing has faced for many years."
"u.s. manufacturing output--as measured in the federal reserve's index of industrial production--plunged about 20 percent during the recession."
"partly as a result, u.s. manufacturing employment fell 2-1/4 million during 2008 and 2009, a significantly larger percentage decline than occurred in overall employment."
"and while manufacturing employment nationwide has increased about 850,000 since the end of 2009 as production has recovered, there are still almost 1-1/2 million fewer manufacturing jobs than just before the recession."
"unfortunately, the number of u.s. manufacturing jobs has been generally decreasing since its peak in the late 1970s."
"a similar trend has also been seen in ohio, where manufacturing jobs have shrunk from about 25 percent of the state's private-sector employment in 1990 to about 15 percent now."
"so, some of the decline in manufacturing jobs since the recession reflects the longer-term structural downtrend of employment in this sector."
"this painful trend reflects a number of long-term challenges faced by domestic manufacturers, including the relative costs of labor and investment in producing domestically versus abroad."
"however, u.s. factory workers, on average, are more productive than their counterparts abroad, and domestic manufacturers report that they are looking for more workers with these greater skills as they increase their use of automation and redesign their production processes."
"current conditions in the labor market       as i noted, the national unemployment rate has declined markedly during the economic recovery."
"cyclical and structural factors both have affected a number of measures of labor market outcomes that bear on our assessment of slack, including labor force participation (that is, how many people are working or are actively looking for work), the number of people working part time who would rather work full time, the pace of hiring, and the rate at which people are quitting jobs."
"let's first consider the labor force participation rate."
"many working-age people who are not in the labor force have chosen that status voluntarily; examples would include retirees, teenagers and young adults in school, and people staying home to care for children and other dependent family members."
"even in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would prefer not to work."
"and, indeed, a noticeable portion of the decline in labor force participation seen over the past decade or so clearly relates to the aging of baby boomers and their ongoing retirements.2 however, the pace of decline in the participation rate accelerated during the recession, as some individuals who lost their jobs became discouraged and stopped looking for work."
"nevertheless i think a significant number of individuals still are not seeking work because they perceive a lack of good job opportunities, and that a stronger economy would draw some of them back into the labor force."
"another factor we consider when assessing labor market slack is the elevated number of workers who are employed in part-time jobs but would prefer to have full-time work--in other words, those classified as ""part time for economic reasons."""
"some portion of the greater share of workers who are part time for economic reasons may reflect structural rather than cyclical factors.3 for example, the ongoing shift in employment away from manufacturing and toward services, a sector which historically relied more heavily on part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs."
"for example, the rate at which employees quit their jobs for other opportunities has tended to go up in a strong economy, since more workers voluntarily leave their jobs when they have greater confidence about their ability to find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires."
"another important indicator is the number of available positions, or job openings, that employers currently have posted."
"additional jobs and potentially faster wage growth bolster household incomes, and lower energy prices mean consumers have more money to spend on other goods and services."
"but we do know that productivity ultimately depends on many factors, including our workforce's knowledge and skills along with the quantity and quality of the capital equipment, technology, and infrastructure that they have to work with."
"see tomaz cajner, dennis mawhirter, christopher nekarda, and david ratner (2014), ""why is involuntary part-time work elevated?"""
"household spending slowed, while both business investment and net exports declined."
"in addition, u.s. labor markets have continued to improve."
"for the first five months of this year, payroll job gains have averaged 217,000 per month."
"both long-term unemployment and involuntary part-time employment declined as well."
"we have a diverse group of professionals participating in this conference, from industry, academia, and government."
"last week, the full task force met to continue the work."
"some of you will recognize that man as frank abagnale, former con artist and now a security consultant."
"it is a vast network with millions of endpoints and a wide variety of participants."
"one study found that more than 20 percent of security incidents could be attributed to insiders.4 segregation of duties, background checks, and monitoring for anomalies help reduce the risk of insider threats."
"the national institute of standards and technology's cybersecurity framework is one of many voluntary cybersecurity frameworks that provide a holistic, risk-based approach to planning.5 in addition to preventive measures, the framework identifies four additional core functions: identify, detect, respond, and recover."
"our experience to date has been that transparency around the stress testing exercise improves the credibility of the exercise and creates accountability both for firms and supervisors."
"second, i will also want to see further improvement in the labor market with solid further employment growth and further evidence of a narrowing of resource utilization gaps based on various indicators, including the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, the percentage of employees who are working part time for economic reasons, and faster wage growth."
"even so, job gains still appear to be consistent with declining labor market slack, as do indicators such as unemployment insurance claims and job openings, which remain robust."
"for example, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its declining pre-crisis trend, and the number of employees who are working less than they would like is still elevated relative to pre-crisis standards."
"the mexican crisis began within four months of my joining the imf."
"total foreign investment in the united states is even larger, at more than $30 trillion."
"a wide range of foreign shocks affect u.s. domestic spending, production, prices, and financial conditions."
"the unemployment rate hit 10 percent nationally, and it reached 11.3 percent here in rhode island."
"nationally, payrolls shrank by some 8-1/2 million, about 6 percent, and the 41,000 jobs lost in rhode island represented close to 8 percent of the state's employment."
"the pace of job gains has gradually strengthened, and payrolls expanded by more than 3 million in 2014 alone."
"one sign of a stronger labor market is that the number of job openings has risen impressively, and another is that more workers are quitting their jobs, signaling greater confidence in their ability to find a new job."
"rhode island is sharing in this recovery, but i am well aware that economic conditions remain difficult here."
"rhode island's unemployment rate improved very slowly during the recovery, and, for a time, it was the highest of any state."
"the jobless rate has come down a lot over the past year or so, but at 6.3 percent in march, unemployment here remains above the national average, and payroll employment has yet to regain its pre-recession peak."
"to be classified as unemployed, people must report that they are actively seeking work, and many people without jobs say they are not doing so--that is, they are classified as being out of the labor force."
"most people out of the labor force are there voluntarily, including retirees, teenagers, young adults in school, and people staying home to care for children."
"but i also believe that a significant number are not seeking work because they still perceive a lack of good job opportunities."
"in addition to those too discouraged to seek work, an unusually large number of people report that they are working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs, and i suspect that much of this also represents labor market slack that could be absorbed in a stronger economy."
"and in rhode island, average hourly earnings have not risen at all in the past year."
"the recovery has by now boosted tax revenue in most states, though rhode island, i know, is among those areas still facing considerable budget strain."
"and credit availability to both households and small businesses has improved."
"recent indicators of both household spending and business investment have slowed, and industrial output has declined."
"productivity depends on many factors, including our workforce's knowledge and skills and the quantity and quality of the capital, technology, and infrastructure that they have to work with."
"according to the bureau of labor statistics' (bls) employment cost index--which measures both wages and the cost of employer-provided benefits--hourly compensation in private industry rose 2-3/4 percent over the year ended in march after having averaged gains of about 2 percent per year during most of the recovery."
"however, some other prominent aggregate wage measures have remained softer."
"for example, the bls's average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls have increased 2-1/4 percent over the 12 months through april."
"a well-functioning financial sector promotes job creation, innovation, and inclusive economic growth."
"and lax controls in some cases contributed to unethical and illegal behavior by banking organizations and their employees."
"it is noteworthy that this research emphasizes differences across countries, and that the united states is among the most financially developed countries in the world."
"more generally, the federal reserve has invested substantial resources in developing technological tools for examiners to improve the efficiency of both off-site and on-site supervisory activities."
"the labor force participation rate continues to be unusually low, suggesting that potential workers may be waiting on the sidelines for further improvements in job opportunities and wages."
"the number working part time who want full-time jobs also remains elevated."
"for example, figure 2 shows that the congressional budget office has made a series of downward revisions to its estimates of potential output in recent years.7  this supply-side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in the capital stock.8 long spells of unemployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more difficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those who do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out."
"a stronger job market and rising wages may encourage more potential workers to join the labor force.14 over a longer period, stronger demand can produce higher capital investment, driving higher productivity."
"employment and participation in the labor force let's start by considering what it was like to graduate from high school or college in june 2009."
"the overall unemployment rate stood at 9.5 percent, and employers slashed 500,000 jobs that month, the 18th month in a row of job cuts."
"for young people, job prospects were even bleaker."
"nearly one-fourth of teenagers in the labor force were unemployed, and the unemployment rate for people between the ages of 20 and 24 stood at 15.2 percent."
"young african americans and hispanics experienced higher rates of unemployment than their white peers."
"the lack of job opportunities appears to have caused many young people to become so discouraged that they dropped out of the labor force altogether, exacerbating a downtrend and driving labor force participation among young people to historical lows."
"even for those who remained in the labor force and have been fortunate to find work, compensation prospects have been poor."
"for example, inflation-adjusted full-time weekly earnings among 19- to 24-year-olds with only a high school diploma fell about 5 percent between 2008 and 2012.1  of those who have found work, not only are many young people receiving low wages, but also many are working at jobs for which they are overqualified."
"a recent study by the federal reserve bank of boston found that employers responded to the slack labor market by increasing the educational requirements or the number of years of experience required for new hires, which likely froze out many from the labor pool and resulted in the underemployment of others.2 in 2012, roughly 45 percent of college graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 were underemployed, up by one-third relative to 2001 and the highest underemployment rate since the early 1990s.3 moreover, a recent study by economists at the federal reserve bank of new york found that the great recession is prolonging the time it takes for a college graduate to settle into a career.4  recently, the labor market prospects for young people have started to improve, with the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds falling about one-third relative to its peak and inflation-adjusted earnings starting to rise."
"education and student debt  enrollment in colleges and graduate schools increased sharply during the great recession."
"indeed, student indebtedness rose sharply in the years surrounding the great recession.8 the capacity of many families to pay for tuition was substantially reduced by the declines in income and wealth associated with the housing crisis and the deep recession."
"since the outset of the recession, the annual published tuition at four-year public colleges increased 24 percent, after adjusting for inflation, during a period when real median incomes declined 8 percent.10  this confluence of higher enrollments, higher tuitions, reduced family resources, and uneven job prospects has caused outstanding student loan balances to more than double since the start of the great recession.11 moreover, this sharp rise in debt burdens is unevenly distributed across the population, with students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds disproportionately likely to use debt to finance education."
"the federal reserve bank of cleveland recently published an analysis of employment and education patterns for non-college-bound workers in the fourth district's metropolitan area as part of ongoing efforts to improve high school graduation rates and facilitate workforce development in line with local labor market demand.31 cleveland's analysis emphasizes the importance of investing in primary and secondary education, as well as technical education beyond high school, to ensure high school graduates possess the strong analytical and soft skills and the guidance they need to access technical and service jobs that can provide an on-ramp to the middle class."

"1 the review is an ambitious and important initiative."
"first, after years of a slow economic recovery, you are entering the strongest job market in nearly a decade."
"that is probably one reason why younger workers reported feeling significantly more optimistic about the job market compared with 2013, according to a survey published just today by the federal reserve.1 challenges do remain."
"those who graduate and enter the workforce during a strong economy are more likely to find employment, remain employed, and enjoy persistently higher earnings.3 the second reason for optimism is that you have already done the one thing that research shows is most important to a successful and stable working life: earning the degrees you will receive today."
"those with a college degree are more likely to find a job, keep a job, have higher job satisfaction, and earn a higher salary."
"the gap in earnings is significant only a few years after graduation--almost $18,000 a year, according to some recent data."
"for decades, technological advances have increasingly allowed simpler, repetitive tasks to be done more cheaply and safely by machines."
"this kind of work in factories, stores, and offices often required only a high school education."
"at the same time, technological advances have increased demand for workers with the education necessary to perform the ever-growing share of jobs where technology is important."
"more recently, further advances are automating increasingly complex tasks and allowing workers with the ability and flexibility to use technology to be more productive."
"higher education has also changed in response, and one of the most important things many of you learned at the university of baltimore was how to learn, adapt, and succeed in the technology-rich environment of most workplaces."
"the second major development in the job market is globalization, which allows goods and services to be produced wherever it is most economical."
"like technological change, globalization has reinforced the shift away from lower-skilled jobs that require less education to higher-skilled jobs that require college and advanced degrees."
"research shows that a large share of the benefits i have described from higher education comes only to those who graduate."

"employers have been adding roughly 180,000 jobs per month so far this year--a pace a little below that of the past several years but significantly higher than underlying growth in the labor force (figure 2)."
"despite these strong job gains, the unemployment rate has flattened out this year after several years of sharp declines, thanks to welcome developments in labor force participation (figure 3)."
"the labor force participation rate represents the percentage of adults aged 16 and over who are in the labor force, which is defined to include only those who are employed or actively looking for work."

"understanding the changing nature of employment in today's economy is not only central to the mission of the federal reserve, but also goes to the core of who we are as providers for our families and productive members of society.1  in contrast to traditional work arrangements, in which an employee has a durable employment relationship with a single primary employer, a large and growing proportion of the workforce is working through contracting, temporary arrangements, on-call arrangements, or as freelancers being hired for episodic ""gigs."""
"they often provide considerably greater flexibility than long-term employment contracts, allowing workers and employers to move in and out of work relationships easily."
"depending on the nature of the employment relationship, this enhanced flexibility could have benefits and costs that accrue to workers and employers very differently."
"for monetary policy, the growth of contingent work affects the way we assess maximum employment and the way we interpret important labor market outcomes, such as the level of part-time employment and aggregate hours worked."
"richer and timely data and analysis could help guide employers, workers, and public officials toward outcomes where benefits and risks are better understood and managed."
"last year, larry katz and alan krueger conducted a version of the contingent worker survey (cws) to track alternative and nonstandard work arrangements using the rand american life panel.2 their findings are striking: over the past decade, contingent workers have increased by roughly one-half and now make up 16 percent of the workforce."
"the largest increase in contingent work over this time has been among workers whose services are contracted out by another company, which rose from 0.6 percent to 3.1 percent of the workforce."
"on-call workers expanded from 1.7 percent to 2.6 percent of the workforce.5  over this same period, technological platforms have emerged that are transforming the way people identify, schedule, and engage in contingent work and are also helping people to monetize their assets to generate income."
"although the data are still relatively sparse, it appears that the number of workers using online platforms to secure gigs is still small but is growing quickly.6 katz and krueger found that workers who provide services through three online intermediaries accounted for only 0.5 percent of all workers in 2015."
"diana farrell and fiona greig (2016) reach a similar conclusion, using a unique and rich data set.7  the federal reserve board fielded a survey to better understand the many ways adults are generating income, regardless of their employment status and the frequency of these activities."
"the survey uses an expansive concept of contingent work, capturing all of the activity individuals are undertaking to generate income."
"the enterprising and informal work activity survey, or eiwa, suggests that more than a third--36 percent--of the adult population undertook informal paid work activity either as a complement to, or as a substitute for, more traditional and formal work arrangements.8 similarly, a survey undertaken by upwork and the freelancers union that also uses an expansive definition of contingent work finds that 35 percent of the labor force engages in freelance work.9  the upwork survey provides further insight by subdividing the 35 percent of the labor force who have done some form of informal work over the past 12 months into five categories."
"in the categories most comparable with the katz and krueger cws categories, roughly 12 percent of the workforce identify as independent contractors who do not have an employer and engage in project-by-project work, whereas between 2 and 3 percent are traditional contract or temporary workers who have a single employer or project at a time and whose work status is temporary."
"by contrast, roughly half of the upwork respondents do informal work in addition to traditional employment relationships; almost 10 percent derive their income from multiple different types of arrangements, including both traditional employment relationships and freelancing, while about 9 percent report having a full-time traditional job and ""moonlighting"" to gain additional income on top of that."
"finally, the eiwa survey provides valuable insights into the use of recent technologies in informal work."
"the eiwa survey suggests that over the previous six months, roughly 11 percent of adults in the united states have engaged in paid services using an online platform, such as arranging transportation activities with companies such as uber, arranging work opportunities on sites like care.com, amazon mechanical turk, or taskrabbit, generating projects through companies such as fiverr, selling goods and crafts on sites such as ebay and etsy, and renting rooms or homes through services like airbnb, among others.10 this figure is much larger than the katz and krueger finding of 0.5 percent, partly because the eiwa survey was fielded to all adults regardless of their formal employment status, asked about all online paid services, and used a six-month look-back period, rather than the past week."
"together, these recent surveys of informal work paint a varied picture of the universe of informal work arrangements, along with participants' motivations for engaging in them."
"nineteen percent of informal workers in the eiwa survey, for example, were engaged in three or more online and/or offline informal paid work activities in the prior six months, and 25 percent indicated that informal and contingent work activities have been ""very much"" or ""somewhat"" a regular and consistent source of their monthly income."
"results regarding the ages of workers attracted to nontraditional work vary: katz and krueger find that the share of contingent work arrangements increases with age, while the upwork study finds that freelancing is more prevalent among the young."
"the earnings experiences of contingent workers appear to span a wide range."
"katz and krueger find that those engaged in contingent work tend to be concentrated in the highest income quintiles."
"but while independent contractors and contract workers earn relatively high wages, on-call and temporary-help work tends to occur among workers in lower wage quintiles."
"one common theme that emerges is the desire to earn extra money, which is a primary motivation for 74 percent of part-time, and 68 percent of full-time, freelancers in the upwork survey."
"similarly, in the eiwa survey, 65 percent of informal workers reported that earning income was their main reason for engaging in informal and contingent work, and the eiwa provides many examples that corroborate this result.11 a full-time restaurant cook in his 50s, reports that he does yard work and sells items both online and offline to earn extra income and to help family members."
"he averages 60 hours per month from side and gig work and reported that these earnings constitute 75 percent of his household's monthly earnings."
"similarly, a respondent in her 20s works part time as a dental hygienist and supplements this employment with about 8 hours per month of additional gig work."
"she said that the gig work somewhat mitigated the effect of the great recession, which found her working fewer hours, with stagnant wages and a loss of benefits."
"for example, a mother in her 20s reported spending 12 hours per month selling self-crafted items online, babysitting, and completing online tasks, collectively providing about 20 percent of her family's income."
"many others find themselves in highly variable work arrangements not by preference but because of the requirements of their employers."
"as employers have outsourced noncore tasks to contract firms and moved to technologically enabled ""just-in-time"" scheduling of employees, contract workers and on-call workers have had to adjust to variable and sometimes unpredictable hours."
"as these stories indicate, there are a variety of reasons workers engage in alternative and nonstandard work arrangements."
"while some supplement their traditional job, using their free time to earn extra income, others cobble together contingent work arrangements or gigs to generate necessary income in the absence of traditional work opportunities."
"still others move into contingent work arrangements due to their employers' work requirements."
"while some workers seem to appreciate the greater opportunities contingent work arrangements provide, others engage in this work out of necessity because they appear unable to obtain a full-time traditional work arrangement that meets their needs."
"overall, the upwork study finds that 63 percent of freelancers say they are pursuing this type of work by choice, while 37 percent do it out of necessity."
"one possibility is that new technologies, by lowering the barriers to workforce entry, could raise employment and labor force participation."
"because there are fixed costs to obtaining and maintaining a job--such as searching for the job, learning about the job, and traveling to the job site every workday--the traditional work arrangement embeds incentives for individuals to work only one job, thus minimizing these fixed costs."
"and for those individuals who desire to work relatively few hours, these fixed costs in the past may have led to a decision to remain out of the labor force."
"but if technology makes it less costly for individuals to find work, manage multiple work relationships, and flexibly work more or fewer hours as their schedule permits, this could significantly increase workers' options and have important effects on labor market behavior."
"new technologies could also make it easier for individuals' actual hours to match their desired hours of work in a day or a week."
"instead of seeing hours per week bunched around 40, we may see greater variation in the hours that individuals work."
"lower barriers to workforce entry may make it more attractive for more individuals to work only a few hours a week if they desire--and can afford--to do so."
"at the same time, by making it easier to find additional work, new technologies may lead to more individuals working greater-than-full-time hours every week."
"in addition, we may see individuals changing the number of hours they work more frequently, as these changes become less costly."
"both the eiwa and upwork surveys confirm that gig work does, indeed, lower barriers to workforce entry and increase hours and flexibility for some individuals."
"the increasing prevalence of gig work may also affect the unemployment rate and productivity."
"regarding productivity, gig work could lower aggregate productivity to the extent that it requires less human capital or specialized knowledge than traditional jobs, or if it primarily increases hours worked by lower-skilled individuals."
"as a result, workers' downtime and the time required to acquire new clients and manage existing clients may decrease, in which case resource utilization and productivity may increase."
"if new technologies make it easier to find gig work, then we could see unemployment rise less in recessions, to the extent that gig workers are counted as employed."
"however, it could be that individuals who are able to avoid unemployment through contingent work would still be underemployed if it is difficult to cobble together enough gigs to achieve full-time employment."
"welfare should increase in cases where gig work meets the needs of workers by providing a low-barrier means of accessing employment and by allowing workers to better match actual hours worked with desired hours of work, especially if the gig work is available at times and in places where traditional work opportunities are in short supply."
"for example, 24 percent of informal workers in the eiwa survey indicated that contingent work had offset their spells of unemployment, loss of working hours, loss of benefits, or frozen wages in their formal employment ""very much"" or ""somewhat."""
"in addition, three-fourths of uber drivers say that the greater control over their work schedules that uber allows has made their lives better.12  however, there are likely many workers who would prefer regular full-time traditional work to contingent work, particularly if much of the power in determining hours worked in alternative work arrangements belongs to the employer."
"technological advances have enabled firms to use just-in-time strategies for their employees, making them in effect on-call workers."
"several recent articles describe the challenges faced by these just-in-time workers, who must conform their hours to the daily and even hourly ebbs and flows of business, often not knowing whether they will have work on a given day until they call in that morning to inquire.13 these arrangements can leave workers scrambling to patch together child care, elder care, and transportation to meet the often unpredictable demands of their workplace, while making it difficult to engage in regularly scheduled activities to enhance their income and opportunities, such as a second job or career training."
"while such workers often are not given full-time work, they often must make themselves available to work full-time hours."
"according to one survey, 71 percent of retail workers in new york stated that their hours fluctuated from week to week, while half said their employers could change their hours at will.14 it is also notable that the increase in contingent work over the past decade has coincided with an increase of one-third in the share of employees working part time but who would prefer to work full time from 3 percent prior to the great recession to close to 4 percent today."
"in addition, contingent workers may receive lower wages, less training, and fewer benefits than their counterparts with traditional jobs."
"typically, the wages of low-skilled employees within a company are boosted by social norms regarding pay equity, and nonpecuniary benefits are often equalized across a company's employees, in certain cases as mandated by law.15 however, the wages that contractors receive are unlikely to reflect the same equity considerations."
"moreover, contingent work generally does not offer employer-based benefits and workplace protections that come with traditional employment opportunities, like overtime compensation, minimum wage protections, health insurance, family leave, employer-sponsored retirement plans, workers' compensation, and paid sick leave."
"as a result, for some, contingent work may entail greater risks than in traditional full-time employment, with more variable and less predictable hours and earnings."
"the upwork study notes that one of freelancers' biggest concerns is managing income variability and benefits."
"for lower-income workers, unpredictable fluctuations in income can lead to severe hardship."
"the federal reserve board's survey of household economics and decisionmaking, for example, finds that 46 percent of households report that they would need to borrow money or sell something in order to pay an unexpected expense of $400.16  these findings suggest that employers, policymakers, and workers should seek ways to help individuals better manage the risks inherent in most forms of contingent work."
"for example, we may need to enhance social safety net programs, such as unemployment and disability insurance, to better support some types of contingent work."
"we may also want to encourage the additional saving that many contingent workers need to ensure that their basic consumption needs are not sacrificed when demand for their work declines, perhaps by providing monetary or other types of incentives."

"the contingent worker survey is the main survey used by the bureau of labor statistics for tracking alternative and nonstandard work."
"the u.s. government accountability office (gao) study of the contingent workforce shows an increase of 5 percentage points in the share of contingent work arrangements, although this shift took place from 2006 to 2010."
"the gao's definition of contingent work covers a much larger share of the workforce, 40.4 percent in 2010, than the cws."
"in the same vein, a 2014 survey by the federal reserve bank of boston found that roughly 44 percent of its survey's respondents participated in some informal paid work activity during the previous two years."
"by contrast, studies conducted by the federal reserve bank of boston in 2013 and 2015 found that approximately one in four respondents--or more than half of informal work participants--say they earned money through informal work activities conducted online."
"in addition, the upwork definition is similar to the eiwa in counting as informal workers those individuals with traditional full- or part-time work who also engage in some informal work, in contrast to katz and krueger and the bls cws, which try to differentiate those workers who predominantly engage in contingent work."

"unfortunately, most studies of the labor market during this period do not directly speak to this issue, although holzer, raphael, and stoll (2006) investigate changes in employers' willingness to hire less-skilled workers during these years, while katz and krueger (1999) and my own study with blinder (2001) explore the somewhat related question of how the u.s. economy was able to simultaneously experience rapid growth, low unemployment, and low inflation in the late 1990s."
"so far this year, payrolls are reported to have increased by 180,000 per month."
"that is down from last year's gains of 230,000 per month but well above what is needed to provide jobs for new entrants into the labor force."

"next, i would like to discuss two current questions that economists are actively debating: first, why is participation in our nation's labor force declining?"
"the proportion of adults participating in the labor force--that is, either holding jobs or actively searching for employment--has declined substantially over the past decade."
"in other words, they dropped out of the labor force."
"however, much of the decline in labor force participation reflects factors that precede the recession.2 most significantly, our population is aging, and older people participate in the labor market at lower rates than younger adults."
"economists are examining a number of reasons why prime-age males are falling out of the labor force."
"some economists have emphasized the role of public assistance programs, such as disability insurance."
"other economists have put more emphasis on the effects of the reduction over time in the demand for lower-skilled labor.3 indeed, the wages of high school graduates have fallen sharply in comparison with the wages of college graduates over the past 40 years."
"many economists believe that the decline in demand for lower-skilled workers reflects technological changes.4 for instance, the introduction of information technology such as desktop computers may have boosted the wages of highly skilled workers by more than the wages of workers with fewer skills."
"first, economic mobility varies substantially across the united states."
"only about one-fourth of tenured and tenure-track faculty members in u.s. academic economics departments are women, and only around 5 percent are african american or hispanic."
"as in many other fields, economics undergoes continual redesign by its practitioners."
"our economists have recently served as visiting faculty at howard or have given guest lectures here."
"i would also like to make you aware that the board offers internships to qualified students, including howard students studying economics."
"moreover, the federal reserve board's office of diversity and inclusion is coordinating an effort to increase the diversity of our staff.8 everyone at the board with responsibility for recruiting, hiring, management, and promotion is involved."
"one study finds that factors such as educational attainment and inheritances almost entirely explain the gap between the wealth of white families and that of hispanic families."

"the share of employees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained noticeably above its pre-crisis level."
"this year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below last year's pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack."
"these developments suggest that an improving job market has made joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the labor market has room for further improvement."
"over the 12 months ending in june, the employment cost index for private-sector workers also increased 2.4 percent."
"average hourly earnings for all workers were not available for this period."
"although the unemployment rate has remained fairly steady this year, near 5 percent, broader measures of labor utilization have improved."

"the choice of a single agency versus multiple agencies involves the well-known tradeoff between relative coherence of approach and linkage with other agency functions and expertise, on the one hand, versus involvement of multiple agency perspectives and avoidance of too much concentration of authority in a single agency, on the other."
"let's start with the employment mandate."
"the ""quits"" rate--the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs--is about at pre-crisis levels."
"surveys of individuals and businesses suggest that the ease of finding and filling jobs is similar to that experienced in the mid-2000s."
"important among these is the labor force participation rate."
"if someone leaves the labor force for any reason, even temporarily, that person is not counted as unemployed."
"so the labor force participation rate is also a key determinant of the unemployment rate."
"labor force participation is influenced by many factors, including the age structure of the population and individuals' perceptions of the availability of jobs."
"participation rose steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s as increasing numbers of women entered the formal workforce."
"i am inclined to believe that there are potential workers at the margins of the labor market who will return as the recovery continues, the labor market tightens further and wages increase."
"the u.s. participation rate for workers in the 25-54 age group is now below those of most other advanced economies, including the u.k., france and germany, for example."
"the number of part-time workers who want full time work remains above pre-crisis levels, which suggests that there may be some remaining slack there as well."
"in addition, we should expect to see stronger wage increases as the labor market tightens."
"i have also expected the ongoing healing in labor markets to continue, with healthy wage increases and job creation."
"labor productivity is a function of three things."
"the first two are the skills of the labor force, and the tools they have, particularly equipment, software and the like."
"workers change jobs and move around the country (or the world) as their careers evolve and as companies grow and shrink."
"these processes can be painful and messy for both workers and firms, but they are essential to the allocation of resources to their highest, most productive uses."
"fewer start-ups has meant lower ""job flows,"" as measured by job creation and destruction, and fewer opportunities for workers to find better jobs."
"among the costs are that it tends to reduce job switching and employment opportunities for excluded workers, and may restrict competition and thus increase prices faced by consumers."
"we need policies that support labor force participation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and productivity growth."
"see erik brynjolfsson and andrew mcafee (2014), the second machine age: work, progress, and prosperity in a time of brilliant technologies (new york: w.w. norton)."
"in particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and i believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market since the recession."
"i will turn to this past friday's labor market report in a moment, but let me begin with some background: the economy added 2.7 million jobs last year, an average of about 230,000 a month."
"in addition, the bureau of labor statistics' measure of the job openings rate was at a record high in march, and the quits rate--the share of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs--has moved up and in march stood close to its pre-recession levels.1 the increase in the quits rate is a sign that workers are feeling more confident about the job market and are likely receiving more job offers."
"so the overall labor market situation has been quite positive."
"a broader measure of labor market slack that includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work was unchanged."
"while the general picture of the labor market is largely positive, some people are still struggling."
"unemployment rates for young african american and hispanic men without a college degree remain especially high, and one important benefit from further improvement in the labor market would be increased job opportunities for these men and other groups that currently still experience high unemployment."
"later today, i will visit one program that helps workers in west philadelphia learn new skills and then connects them with potential employers, an initiative in which government, businesses, and local institutions are working together successfully."
"new drilling and energy-sector employment have plunged, and the effects have spilled over to businesses serving the energy production sector."
"while the job market has strengthened significantly, gdp increases have been less impressive."
"second, a stronger job market could also support labor market improvement along other dimensions, including greater labor force participation."
"payroll employment is now reported to have increased 123,000 in april and 38,000 in may."
"according to the bureau of labor statistics, payrolls in may were held down about 35,000 by workers on strike at verizon; thus, the strike can account for a relatively small portion of the slowdown in payroll growth in may."
"the verizon workers are now back on the job and should be included in the june payroll counts."
"however, the employment cost index, another broad measure of labor compensation costs, has remained quite soft, rising only 1-3/4 percent over the year ended in march."

"job growth continues to be substantially faster than the underlying growth of the labor force, so the labor market continues to tighten."
"in addition to productivity, the other principal factor in potential output is labor supply, which is determined by the working-age population, the natural rate of unemployment, and the trend labor force participation rate."
"the natural rate of unemployment reflects the matching of characteristics that employers are seeking with those of the unemployed."

"secular stagnation: during world war ii in the united states, many economists feared that at the end of the war, the economy would return to high pre-war levels of unemployment--because with the end of the war, demobilization, and the massive reduction that would take place in the defense budget, there would not be enough demand to maintain full employment."

"it is wonderful to be part of an event that celebrates collaboration between educational institutions, local government, the federal reserve, and employers as they work together to provide appropriate training for young workers to fill local jobs needs."
"collaboration creates a more vibrant workforce that is connected to actual jobs."
"what that means for the young people participating in this program is that this is a great time to find a job."
"moreover, not only is the national unemployment rate low, so are unemployment rates for young people and members of ethnic and racial groups that have traditionally faced greater challenges in the labor market."
"as many of you know, during the deep recession of 2008 and 2009, many americans were so discouraged by poor job prospects that they stopped even looking for work."
"the education and health-care sectors continue to be the main drivers of job growth."
"and, the local community colleges have partnered with local employers to align their curriculums with the employers' job openings, to increase workers' connections to jobs, and to become a resource for regional job information."
"finally, the local government has worked to contend with a long-term loss of jobs in manufacturing and a more recent loss of jobs in professional services by attracting investment in a world-class photonics hub in rochester."
"whereas a few years ago, they might not have been engaged in a lot of hiring, today they tell me that it is becoming more challenging to find well-qualified workers for the job openings they want to fill."
"it means employers are looking for graduates of programs just like yours, which are attuned to the job opportunities of employers."
"pâtech rochester programs offer students professional mentors, job shadowing opportunities, and on-the-job experience to ensure that they are ready to contribute positively to the workplaces of local employers."
"i also understand that companies are investing more in on-the-job training and are strengthening efforts to retain more of the workers they attract, which means younger workers--such as pâtech graduates--have a better chance of securing jobs that lead to long-lasting careers."
"by any measure, the market for younger workers today looks much better than it did in the years just after the great recession, when unemployment rates for teenagers were above 20 percent.3 in fact, firms are turning more and more to programs like p-tech to help them find and train the workers they need."
"workforce development the federal reserve bank of new york is one of the facilitators of the leading the way campaign."
"the federal reserve system has a long-standing interest in understanding labor market dynamics and promoting workforce development opportunities."
"programs like this help workers prepare for jobs and help firms invest in workforce development."
"in october, atlanta established the center for workforce and economic opportunity to focus on employment policies and labor market issues that affect low- and moderate-income individuals."
"the system also recently hosted a national conference in austin to promote the importance of investing in america's workforce.4 as employers' demand for specific education and training increase, collaborative initiatives, like those exhibited through the p-tech programs of greater rochester, will help minimize the skills mismatch appearing in many communities with burgeoning job markets."
"young workers since 2013, the federal reserve board has been administering the survey of young workers to learn more about work experiences and future prospects for 18-to-30-year-olds nationwide."
"the survey data indicate that higher levels of educational attainment are associated with higher earnings, greater job satisfaction, and increased optimism about one's job future."
"second, responses to the survey underscore the importance of young workers receiving appropriate information that enables them to select an educational program that provides better labor market outcomes."
"the survey found that more than 30 percent of young adults did not receive information about jobs and careers in high school and college."
"third, the survey found that many young workers are not employed in fields aligned with their education."
"fewer than half (45 percent) of the young workers surveyed said they were employed in a career field that is closely related to their educational and training background."
"p-tech focuses on aligning education with actual jobs."
"finally, the survey found that steady employment is very important to young workers."

"second, the smartphone ecosystem puts the enormous computing power of the cloud at the fingertips of consumers."
"importantly, cloud computing offers not only the power to process and store data, but also powerful algorithms to make sense of it."
"due to early commitment to open-source principles, app developers have open access to many of the same machine-learning and artificial intelligence tools that power the world's largest internet companies.27 further, the major cloud computing providers have now taken these free building blocks and created different machine-learning and artificial intelligence stacks on their cloud platforms."
"they facilitate its use by developers, by cleaning the data, standardizing it across institutions, and offering their own application programming interfaces for easy integration."
"other companies are paid by employers, who then provide the products free of charge to their employees as an employee benefit."
"overall, fintech assistants have increasingly improved the disclosures that explain to consumers how they get paid, but this is still a work in progress."

"second, we learned that in order to take advantage of new business opportunities in the regional food sector, entrepreneurs need access to capital, specialized knowledge, and general business skills."
"we also learned that organizations across the country are filling these gaps and empowering communities to take advantage of opportunities."
"as a result of an intentional focus on equity and inclusiveness, these investments can create new access to economic opportunity for segments of communities that have often faced challenges, such as people of color, recent immigrants, the formerly homeless, and the previously incarcerated."

"in fact, a recent report found boston to have one of the highest rates of income inequality among the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the united states, despite the overall strength of boston's economy.4 findings like this remind us that not all communities are well positioned to access the opportunities available in the economy, even those in their own backyard."
"a cross-section of partners from the public, private, nonprofit, and philanthropic sectors sought to achieve this, in part, by embedding family resource centers within the lawrence public schools."

"this is important work, both for the parties to these contracts and for our financial stability."
"the banking industry has traditionally been characterized by physical branches, privileged access to financial data, and distinct expertise in analyzing such data.1 but in today's world companies need not be bound by physical infrastructure and related overhead expenses."
"similarly, payment providers can now leverage the application programming interfaces (apis)--essentially the protocols--of smartphone messaging services to integrate their payment tools directly into messaging applications: nowadays, consumers can simply ""attach"" money while messaging a friend."
"while the task force was focused on improving speed and convenience, it also underscored the importance of safety and security by establishing 11 criteria of a total of 36 focused on those objectives."
"we are very grateful to the members of the faster payment task force for all of their work and for the collaborative spirit they brought to the job."
"a range of innovative products that seamlessly integrate with other services is now available at our fingertips."
"economic activity in the united states has been growing moderately so far this year, and the labor market has continued to strengthen."
"starting with the labor market, through august, payroll job gains averaged 170,000 per month this year, down only a little from the average pace of gains in 2016 and still well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force."
"in september, payrolls were reported to have declined 33,000, but that weakness reflected the effects of hurricane irma, which hit florida during the reference week for the september labor market surveys."
"other aspects of the jobs report for september were strong."
"other labor market indicators, including the rates of job openings and the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs, also point to strength."
"outside this room, you are competitors, and that vigorous competition serves your firms, your customers, and ultimately the u.s. taxpayer."
"i first encountered treasury markets in a serious way 25 years ago, when i served as under secretary of the treasury for finance under president george h. w. bush."
"we also knew that, despite the misconduct by salomon brothers, treasury markets generally worked quite well."
"we are well aware that community banks serve communities, businesses, and households that are often underserved by larger institutions and offer more extensive and more personalized services than are often otherwise available."
"we know that community bankers are part of the communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the aspirations of their customers."
"one of the most effective ways of showing a commitment to a diverse customer base is showing a commitment to a diverse workforce."

"labor force participation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than unemployment rates, with the rate for african americans lowest at 62.2 percent."
"even more striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age and education levels.9 although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups are still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably during the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades."
"differences in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during recessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and these differences shrink during recoveries."
"differences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women relative to white women, and for hispanics relative to whites."
"after controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and informal social networks that may be an important source of information and support regarding employment opportunities.13 federal reserve work on labor market disparities while the policy tools available to the federal reserve are not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in labor market outcomes, understanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth."
"the survey of household economics and decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, employment, housing, and debt; the survey of young workers provides insights into younger adults' employment experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the enterprising and informal work activities survey provides information about income generating activities that are often outside the scope of other employment and income surveys.14 each recent edition of the semiannual monetary policy report (mpr) has focused on some aspect of the comparative economic experience of different racial and ethnic groups."
"the investing in america's workforce initiative is a collaboration between the federal reserve system and academic research institutions to promote investment in workforce skills that better align with employers' needs.15 in short, a deeper understanding of labor market disparities is central to the mission of the federal reserve because it may help us better assess full employment, where resources may be underutilized, and the likely evolution of the labor market and overall economic activity."

"although the unemployment rate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization, some indicators have shown less improvement since the financial crisis.10 as the solid blue line in figure 6 illustrates, the employed share of the ""prime-age worker"" population--that is, persons from ages 25 to 54--remains noticeably below the 2007 level.11 but employment rates for this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining employment opportunities for less-skilled workers, a rising number of people receiving disability insurance, and other worrisome trends.12 similarly, although the share of part-time workers who would like a full-time job is still somewhat above where it stood before the last two recessions (the dashed red line), it could reflect a structural change in firms' reliance on part-time labor.13 in addition, these two measures have to be weighed against other labor indicators that have either returned to, or are currently above, their pre-recession levels."

"it is striking that in larger metro areas, the labor force participation rate for prime-age men has recently retraced much of the decline experienced during the recession, while in smaller metro and rural areas, the labor force participation rate remains well below its pre-recession level, with only modest improvements of late."
"for example, a growing body of research has identified a steeper decline in the employment and labor force attachment of prime-age men in areas of the country that specialized in the industries that were most negatively affected by increased imports from china.25 research suggests that some of the decline in prime-age labor force participation relates to some individuals' reduced ability or desire to work, in some cases resulting directly from the ongoing decline in job opportunities."
"there are many reasons why some prime-age men may be less willing or able to work."
"in addition, employment in non-metro areas tends to be more concentrated in manufacturing, which is the sector that has experienced the largest decline in employment from automation and globalization.29 similarly, research suggests that workers in less populous areas have been more likely to be directly affected by increased import competition from china due to the geographical distribution of industries.30 and for many less populous areas, job opportunities are less diverse than in bigger cities, so that when a plant shuts down, there are fewer local alternative job opportunities for unemployed workers, especially with comparable levels of employment security or benefits."
"a conventional assumption in economics is that regional differences should narrow over time as workers move toward areas where jobs are more plentiful and wages are higher.31 in reality, americans' propensity to move is currently at its lowest level in many decades."
"some of the decline may be related to changes in the labor market, perhaps because workers are more likely to perceive that job opportunities are no better elsewhere, and consequently that the labor market returns to switching jobs or locations--in terms of better wages or higher job quality--have declined.33 also, zoning requirements may be boosting housing costs in cities where job opportunities are most abundant, such as san francisco, pricing out many potential workers and inhibiting migration.34 whatever the reason, the fact that families are less likely to move now than in the past suggests that many of those in less populous areas are not able to access the economic opportunity present in denser and more diversified large metropolitan areas at a time when the gap in labor market outcomes for larger metros relative to other areas continues to grow."

"first, the economy and the housing sector are healthy."
"this was innovative and necessary work."
"to begin with the labor market, many indicators suggest that the economy is close to full employment."
"in april, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent, a level not reached since may 2007 and below most current estimates of the natural rate of unemployment (figure 1).1 estimates of the natural rate are inherently uncertain, but other labor market measures are also near their pre-crisis levels, including a broader measure of labor market underutilization that includes those who would like to work but have not recently looked for a job and those working part time who want full-time work.2 the labor force participation rate, which had declined sharply after the crisis, has now been roughly stable for 3-1/2 years, which represents an improvement against its estimated downward trend (figure 2)."
"there are several other measures of nominal wage growth in addition to the bureau of labor statistics' (bls) average hourly earnings."
"the bls employment cost index measure of year-over-year wage and salary growth was also 2.5 percent in the first quarter, while the bls measure of compensation per hour rose to 3.9 percent."
"the unit labor cost measure is based on the bls measures of compensation per hour and productivity for the business sector."
"we need policies that support business investment, labor force participation, and productivity growth."

"the labor market has continued to strengthen."
"payroll growth has averaged 175,000 over the past three months, more than sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market."
"moreover, the share of employees who work part time for economic reasons has recently moved down close to its pre-crisis level, after a long period of remaining at elevated levels."
"while it is encouraging that the share of employees who work part time for economic reasons has continued to move down, there may well be slack remaining along this margin."
"as i noted earlier, the unemployment rate is now at 4.4 percent, and we are seeing improvement in other measures of labor market slack, such as participation and the share of those working part time for economic reasons."
"this local presence, by design, gives us valuable perspectives on how americans are experiencing the economy in different communities around the country and critical insights about the varied challenges that lie beneath the aggregate numbers."
"inclusion and maximum employment inclusion is an enduring goal of public policy that is embodied in our maximum-employment mandate."

"""2 maximum employment is inherently an inclusive goal."
"we can also see persistent disparities by gender, such as the well-known wage premium earned by men relative to women with similar experience and expertise.7 with its focus on inclusive growth, this institute could give us important insights on how far the overall economy is from full employment, as well as the barriers that could be limiting the economy's potential, by studying labor market outcomes of men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in more depth.8 research on the drivers of disparities in labor market outcomes can also help the federal reserve better assess potential tradeoffs in monetary policy."
"for instance, rod adams, a neighborhood advocate here in minneapolis, noted the unemployment rate for african americans locally was still almost 9 percent late last summer and observed that ""if the labor market were truly healthy, people in my community would all be able to find full-time jobs at decent wages."
"the federal reserve's community development work is invaluable in supporting our efforts to understand and improve the labor market experiences of different groups.10 for instance, during the great recession, workforce development organizations in atlanta found themselves overwhelmed by the sharp rise in unemployment, which highlighted the need for a better connected and stronger network of job training and placement services."
"i recently spent time with these organizations, along with community members and some of our atlanta staff, who have been working on the creation of the metro atlanta exchange (or max) for workforce solutions, the region's only comprehensive directory for workforce development services."
"just as there is a connection between maximum employment and inclusive growth, so, too, there is an important connection between potential output and opportunity."
"in visits to detroit, milwaukee, north st. louis, and baltimore, i have heard from residents and community organizations about the challenging barriers standing between the many workers seeking jobs and the many jobs seeking workers."
"families living in neighborhoods with high concentrations of poverty and low economic or demographic diversity are more likely to experience a range of negative outcomes, including exposure to crime and violence, physical and mental health problems, and weak academic performance.35 low-skilled workers who live far from potential employers or accessible transportation networks have more difficulty finding and keeping jobs.36 these effects of geography on opportunity can stretch from one generation to the next."

"a historical perspective on women in the labor force from the time that brown began to accept women and into the 1920s, most women in the united states did not work outside the home, and those who did were primarily young and unmarried."
"in that era, just 20 percent of all women were ""gainful workers,"" as the census bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such.2 of course, these statistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy beyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women's work in the home often included work in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural products, for sale."
"african american women were about twice as likely to participate in the labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to remain in the labor force after marriage.3 what was true for women in general was also true of the early graduates of what was then called the women's college, the large majority of whom got married, raised families, and did not pursue careers."
"the fact that many women left work upon marriage reflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures."
"the occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely circumscribed."
"most women lacked significant educationââonly 54 percent of girls aged 5 to 19 were enrolled in school in 1890.4 and women with little education mostly toiled as piece workers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often unsafe."
"fewer than 2 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in an institution of higher education, and just one-third of those were women.5 such women did not have to perform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained."
"or you could go into office work and be a secretary."
"in her oral history, doris madeline hopkins, a 1928 graduate, talked about the opportunity that she had to work, but also about being told she had to leave her job once she got married."
"despite the widespread sentiment against women, particularly married women, working outside the home and with the limited opportunities available to them, women did enter the labor force in greater numbers over this period, with participation rates reaching nearly 50 percent for single women by 1930 and nearly 12 percent for married women."
"by 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were participating in the labor force.7 several factors contributed to this rise."
"first, with the advent of mass high school education, graduation rates rose substantially.8 at the same time, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and these jobs were increasingly taken on by women."
"moreover, because these jobs tended to be cleaner and safer, the stigma attached to work for a married woman diminished."
"and while there were still marriage bars that forced women out of the labor force, these formal barriers were gradually removed over the period following world war ii."
"that said, early in that period, most women still expected to have short careers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary earners whose husbands' careers came first."
"but, while her husband progressed from instructor to professor at wisconsin, betty worked as an instructor on an ad hoc basis."
"during world war ii, while he worked for the government in washington and new york, betty stayed in madison, teaching math to servicemen."
"when he took a job teaching in california after the war, they divorced, and it was only then that she was a given a position as assistant professor."
"as time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment prospects did change."
"as women gained experience in the labor force, they increasingly saw that they could balance work and family."
"a new model of the two-income family emerged.10 some women began to attend college and graduate school with the expectation of working, whether or not they planned to marry and have families, as did rita schorr-germain, an immigrant who survived auschwitz, graduated from pembroke in 1953, and went on to teach european history while her husband also had a successful academic career."
"as did most women's colleges at the time, pembroke continued to produce nurses, schoolteachers, and social workers, and many women who worked only until they married and had children."
"by contrast, in the 1970s young women more commonly expected that they would spend a substantial portion of their lives in the labor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their educational attainment and taking courses and college majors that better equipped them for careers as opposed to just jobs."
"workplace protections were enhanced through the passage of the pregnancy discrimination act in 1978 and the recognition of sexual harassment in the workplace."
"indeed, regularly in the late 19th and 20th centuries there were calls to protect men from women's entry into the labor force."
"among the women who were fighting for better labor standards early in the 20th century, many were heavily influenced by elite cultural standards that viewed a woman's place as in the home and argued that men should be paid a ""family wage"" that would allow them to support their family singlehandedly--a standard that many working-class families could not afford."
"moreover, many of the labor protections promoted to protect women were often based on theories about women's weaker nature, and these protections served to circumscribe their work.15 during the great depression, limiting women's role in the workforce was considered a way to address the high rates of unemployment, although the experience of those years showed the importance of women in supporting their families financially.16 similarly, women who had successfully worked during world war ii, either as part of the war effort or to support their families while their husbands were fighting, often were pushed out of their jobs to make room for returning soldiers.17 after the war and then single, my relative, betty stafford, remained an assistant professor at the university of wisconsin despite an enviable body of research."
"despite the fears of some that women entering into the workforce would crowd out men, the evidence shows that the rise in women's participation has contributed to widespread improvements in the safety and productivity of our workplaces, to the health of families, and to the macroeconomic success that our country has enjoyed over the past 125 years."
"women's demands for safer factories, humane workweeks, and higher pay, which were often pursued through organizing and striking, contributed substantially to the social upheaval and public debate of that period that eventually led to the passage of stronger labor standards."
"the rise in female labor force participation was an early focus of and helped establish the fields of statistics and labor economics in their modern incarnations."
"carroll wright, the first commissioner of what is now known as the bureau of labor statistics and who established the high standards for data collection and analysis for which the bureau is known, devoted his agency's fourth annual report, for the year 1888, to the topic of working women in large cities.18 moreover, the issues surrounding women's work, such as the minimum wage, pay equity, and maximum workweeks, were topics of great interest to early practitioners of labor economics.19 it is often said that we should welcome women's presence in the workplace because it allows us to capitalize on the talents of our entire population, and this is certainly true."
"it is a well-established finding in the literature on development that maternal education and work are positively associated with better health and educational outcomes for children.21 a recent meta-study also suggests that children in the united states with working mothers do as well if not better in school, both academically and behaviorally, than children with mothers that stay home full time."
"also, as i will discuss, women are making choices that reflect their desire to balance work and family."
"these findings bear on the question of how best to support women's work through public policies aimed at helping women and men better manage work and family."
"27 however, women's participation plateaued at a level well below that of prime working-age men, which stands at over 88 percent."
"as i mentioned earlier, the gap in earnings between men and women has narrowed substantially, but progress has slowed lately, and women working full time still earn about 17 percent less than men, on average, each week.28 even when we compare men and women in the same or similar occupations who appear nearly identical in background and experience, a gap of about 10 percent typically remains.29 as such, we cannot rule out that gender-related impediments hold back women, including outright discrimination, attitudes that reduce women's success in the workplace, and an absence of mentors."
"recent research has shown that although women now enter professional schools in numbers nearly equal to men, they are still substantially less likely to reach the highest echelons of their professions.30 for instance, 47 percent of students at top-50 law schools are female, and women obtain 40 percent of m.b.a.'s from top programs."
"nonetheless, women are still poorly represented among corporate ceos, as partners in top law firms, and as executives in finance.31 even in my own field of economics, women constitute only about one-third of ph.d. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two decades.32 this lack of success in climbing the professional ladder would seem to explain why the wage gap actually remains largest for those at the top of the earnings distribution.33 one of the primary factors contributing to the failure of these highly skilled women to reach the tops of their professions and earn equal pay is that top jobs in fields such as law and business require longer workweeks and penalize taking time off."
"if it is costly for employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high premium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours.36 workplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co-workers, such as law partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks.37 but however sensible such arrangements may be from a business perspective, it can be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children."
"the very fact that these types of jobs require such long hours likely discourages some women--as well as men--from pursuing these career tracks."
"advances in technology have facilitated greater work-sharing and flexibility in scheduling, and there are further opportunities in this direction.38 economic models also suggest that while it can be difficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter hours, if many firms were to change their model, they and their workers could all be better off.39 of course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or that impose such severe penalties for taking time off."
"but the difficulty of balancing work and family is a widespread problem."
"in fact, the recent trend in many occupations is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work for those with family demands and can make it difficult to schedule childcare.40 reforms that encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross-train workers to perform different tasks, or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in exchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs."
"another problem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families.41 and just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution have jobs that provide them with paid family leave.42 this circumstance puts many women in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and keeping their jobs."
"in this context, it is useful to compare the workforce experiences of american women to those in other advanced economies."
"in 1990, the labor force participation rate in the united states of prime working-age women, 74 percent, was higher than in all but a few industrialized nations."
"but in the intervening years, while the participation rate of u.s. women was roughly stable, elsewhere it increased steadily, and by 2010 the united states fell to 17th place out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force participation.43 a number of studies have examined the role of various public policies in explaining patterns in female labor force participation across countries."
"these studies find that policy differences--in particular, the expansion of paid leave following childbirth, steps to improve the availability and affordability of childcare, and increased availability of part-time work--go a long way toward explaining the divergence between advanced economies.44 evidence suggests that if the united states had policies in place such as those employed in many european countries, female labor force participation could be as high as 82 percent.45 however, these policies entail tradeoffs."
"women in other advanced economies are more likely than women in the united states to be employed part time, which could reflect a greater ease in arranging flexible schedules and more time with family, but it also comes with costs, including a wage penalty and fewer opportunities for training and advancement."
"such findings raise the question of whether the policies enacted overseas in recent years have had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive for employers there to hire women into full-time jobs with opportunities for advancement, as women are more likely to be eligible for and to make use of such benefits.46 this possibility should inform our own thinking about policies to make it easier for women and men to combine their family and career aspirations."
"for instance, improving access to affordable and good quality childcare would appear to fit the bill, as it has been shown to support full-time employment.47 recently, there also seems to be some momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth."
"in looking to solutions, we should consider improvements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women, but all workers."

"on the 10th anniversary of the iphone, a wired.com article revealed that even steve jobs hadn't predicted the smartphone's potential as a platform.1 apple was just trying to design an ipod that made phone calls."
"it did so by investing heavily in developing open application programming interfaces (apis) that provided third-party developers clear instructions and open access to the iphone platform."
"specifically, this open architecture makes available to outside developers clear instructions that enable them to use the iphone's various sensors, processors, displays, and other interfaces in combination with their own code to develop new products."
"on top of that, a robust secondary layer of developers use the apis of other developers in their technology stacks to quickly assemble new business models."
"they may use google maps' apis for location services, stripe or braintree's apis for payments, twilio's apis for text messaging, and amazon web services' or ibm's apis for computing power."
"for instance, when pokémon go was first launched, its creator, niantic, used an outdated google api to verify consumer identities."
"if a developer wants to use a google maps api to embed a map in her application, she first must create a developer account with google, agreeing to google's terms and conditions."
"by partnering with data aggregators, banks can open their systems to thousands of developers, without having to invest in creating and maintaining their own open apis."

"first, half of our monetary policy mandate is maximum sustainable employment."
"that means that we need to be aware of employment trends across all communities in america, not just the top-line averages, since unemployment rates vary significantly across races and geographies."

" thank you for this opportunity to be part of the national community reinvestment coalition's annual conference."
"and, as many of you know, we recently revised our interagency guidance to clarify how various community development activities are considered in assessing cra performance, among them workforce development, which is my topic today.2 workforce development initiatives and challenges workforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types of initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement assistance, and other support."
"organizations dedicated to providing workforce development are interested not just in helping people secure any jobs, but jobs that pay well, provide benefits, offer opportunities for advancement, and are less likely to be eliminated during economic downturns."
"as community development practitioners, you know that good-paying, stable jobs are not only important to workers and their families, but also are the foundation of strong neighborhoods."
"in fact, two federal reserve banks recently published a framework describing how workforce development initiatives can fit within a bank's broader cra strategy.3 while the job market for the united states as a whole has improved markedly since the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in lower-income and minority communities show why workforce development is so essential."
"also, a much smaller share of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent during this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with smaller minority populations.5 these elevated unemployment rates and depressed employment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce development options for these communities."
"education as a workforce development strategy probably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the quality of general education."
"however, the rate was nearly double, 5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11 while high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish high school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree.12 the advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-hispanic whites than for african americans and hispanics."
"in recognition of this fact, the u.s. department of education is offering competitive grants to postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus-based childcare programs primarily serving the needs of low-income students.16 i want to reiterate that addressing the particular barriers standing in the way of lower-income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long-term strategy."
"to support programs aimed at students not bound for college, in 2015, the federal reserve banks of philadelphia, cleveland, and atlanta identified occupations with above-average wages for workers without a bachelor's degree in the country's 100 largest metropolitan areas.17 the reserve banks made this information available to workforce development providers online and in workshops."
"educational programs and training that lead to better paying and more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lower-income workers."
"workforce development programs in action in the rest of my remarks, i would like to highlight some examples of successful initiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce development.18 as you know, within our community affairs offices, the federal reserve devotes considerable effort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so i am able to draw on the knowledge and experience of our staff."
"first, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to employment early in their work lives."
"the federal reserve's 2013 survey of young workers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19 other studies have found that students who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher wages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs improved participants' attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic aspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills.20 the findings point to some of the reasons that the boston fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called pocket change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-year-olds in somerville, massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and reinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication."
"in its first two years, the initiative trained 53 low-income young people and placed 20 of them in jobs."
"but more recently, cte has been refined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non-college-bound workers gain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires technical proficiency."
"these programs teach the skills needed to pursue careers in fields such as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology, hospitality, and financial services."
"this point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective cte programs and other workforce development initiatives are able to match education and training to good-paying jobs when they actively engage employers in the training process."
"it delivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for unemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities.22 an evaluation of the program last year in tulsa, new york city, and northeast ohio found it was especially effective because it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications, and it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23 a fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other countries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our country as part of broader career and technical education efforts."
"for instance, a state-run program in south carolina, apprenticeship carolina, helps employers develop apprenticeships at no cost to them."
"businesses receive a $1,000 annual tax credit per apprenticeship, and the program assists them with information and technical needs, paperwork, and the integration of classroom learning at local technical colleges."
"the program has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state.24 similarly, washington state registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term increases in employment rates and hourly wages.25 my fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a greater role in workforce development."
"entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the american economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer income, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job and family commitments."
"yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income communities.26 moreover, when businesses are owned by minorities, they are less likely to have paid employees.27 these findings speak to the opportunities that could be realized by helping people start their own businesses and then helping them grow their businesses."
"programs that equip people with the management skills and knowledge they need to start and operate a successful small business can help."
"relevant and effective training can reduce the failure rate of businesses by helping owners make better decisions and avoid costly mistakes.28 these programs are especially critical in low-income and rural communities where other resources to support small business development may be scarce."
"this situation is true for many minority, women, and low-income borrowers.30 nontraditional lenders, including more than 1,000 community development financial institutions around the country, help fill the gap.31 conclusion to conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has improved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as well as other challenges, remain."
"fortunately, programs such as the ones i have highlighted today can help address these challenges in more targeted ways than the federal reserve is equipped to do through monetary policy."
"whether you work to provide affordable housing, homeownership counseling, small business credit and technical support, or workforce development, i hope you know that you have a partner in the federal reserve."
"moreover, ""over 95 percent of jobs created during the recovery have gone to workers with at least some college education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind"" (as quoted from the introduction on the webpage for anthony p. carnevale, tamara jayasundera, and artem gulish (2016), america's divided recovery: college haves and have-nots (washington: georgetown university center for education and the workforce), https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/americas-divided-recovery)."

"one reason why the frb/us model is well known is that it is in the public domain and is regularly updated for public use, including the provision of a database that is constructed using the median projections from the most recent sep. see brayton, laubach, and reifschneider (2014a) for a broad description of the model and reifschneider, ttlow, and williams (1999) for a description and explanation of model properties."
"since the depths of the great recession, about 15-1/2 million jobs have been added to the u.s. economy, on net."
"as shown in figure 1, a broader measure of labor underutilization--the u-6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also people working part time who would like full-time employment and those who would like a job but are not actively looking--has retraced nearly all of the steep run-up that occurred as a result of the recession.2  other indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered from the severe downturn that occurred in the wake of the financial crisis."
"and some indicators, such as small businesses' assessments of the difficulty of hiring, shown by the solid black line, as well as the average length of time it takes firms to fill vacancies and the job openings rate, even suggest that the labor market is a bit tighter than before the financial crisis."
"of course, both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio are still much lower than they were a decade ago."
"it is true that many employers report difficulties in finding qualified workers in selected occupations, and that more workers are comfortable quitting jobs to take or look for better positions."
"as shown in figure 3, increases in average hourly earnings, the employment cost index, and compensation per hour remain subdued, picking up only modestly of late.6 again, these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor market."

"the sustainable longer-run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as the growth rate of the working-age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the prevalence of self-employment and multiple job holdings, so it cannot be predicted with precision."
"in addition, a persistently strong labor market could potentially lead some firms to rely less on part-time workers, or might encourage some people to rejoin the labor force who would otherwise sit on the sidelines."
"like average hourly earnings, the wgt excludes benefits costs and so is less comprehensive than the eci or business-sector compensation per hour (cph)."
"in addition, the wgt is based on a smaller sample than the measures shown in figure 3 and it only covers a sub-set of the workforce--specifically, employed individuals who were also employed a year ago, and whose earnings are less than $150,000 per year."
"finally, because average hourly earnings and business-sector cph are measured as total wages divided by total hours, an increase in wages for high earners has a larger effect in those measures than a similarly proportioned increase for lower-wage workers, and this is not so for the wgt."
"many other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the prior two years, including the u-6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits, survey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of unemployment."
"additional complications arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the unemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor utilization."
"such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation rate was unusually low and involuntary part-time employment unusually high, given the level of the unemployment rate."

"others may have just graduated and have started looking for a job or have decided to return to working--for instance, when their child starts school."
"sometimes people are ready and willing to work, but their skills, perhaps because of technological advances, are not a good fit for the jobs that are available."
"other measures--such as job training and other workforce development programs--are better suited to address structural unemployment."
"it destroyed nearly 9 million jobs, and it's been a long, slow slog to recover from it."
"it includes people who would like a job but have been too discouraged to look for one and people who are working part time but would rather work full time."
"that means our children can reasonably hope to be better off economically than we are now."
"payroll growth has remained sufficiently strong to continue eroding slack, increasingly along margins that had previously seemed stubbornly elevated--including the long-term unemployed, those on the margins of the labor force, and most recently those who are working part time but would prefer full-time work."
"even so, some slack may remain: relative to pre-crisis levels, the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remains low and the share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains elevated."

"however, the decline in labor force participation following the financial crisis exceeded even what might be expected given this long-standing downward trend-- in particular, as the participation of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 54) fell and teenagers exited the workforce in droves."
"the reasons behind the fall in participation among non-retirement-age workers have been the subject of much debate."
"today, new technologies are lowering transaction costs by automating the customer interface and underwriting processes."
"in particular, it appears that many unbanked or underbanked people in the united states are intentionally choosing not to maintain a bank account, which may hold clues to what underserved families and small businesses actually need."

"many other labor market indicators also suggest an economy near full employment."
"for the first time since the labor department began collecting the data in 2000, there are now more job vacancies than there are people counted as unemployed."
"in addition, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is elevated, a sign that workers are able to find another job when they seek one."
"and surveys show that businesses are finding it difficult to fill vacancies, and that households perceive jobs as plentiful."
"a historical comparison because we have so little experience with very low unemployment, it is interesting to compare today's labor market with that earlier period."
"questions prompted by a tight labor market the lack of useful historical precedent leaves us with some uncertainty about the answers to several important and challenging questions."
"as i mentioned, a tight labor market could draw more people into the labor force."
"in fact, as the labor market has tightened, more workers have been moving back to work and off disability rolls.9 there could also be benefits to productivity and potential growth."
"the labor force participation rate is defined as the number of people either with a job or who have actively looked for work within the past four weeks, as a share of the total population."
"it comprises both the ""frictional"" unemployment of people who are temporarily between jobs or searching as they have reentered the labor force and the more ""structural"" unemployment of people whose skills or physical location are not a good match for the jobs available."
"there are many more women in the workforce now, but while women used to have higher unemployment rates than men, that is no longer the case."

"(the average age of people in the workforce declined through the 1970s as more of the baby-boom generation entered their working years, but it increased subsequently.)"
"sustaining full employment here at home, the labor market is strong."
"for example, educational attainment is much higher today than it was in the 1960s, and college degree holders tend to have much lower unemployment rates, on average, than those with a high school degree or less.4 while the unemployment rate is now lower than before the financial crisis, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-crisis level."

"i am pleased that the federal reserve's community development team has been supporting your work and helping to convene collaborative endeavors, such as the symposium on workforce transportation that occurred in february, and cross-state learning exchanges that connect community development leaders from maryland and the carolinas."
"the federal reserve system has a valuable perspective because we are in communities all across this nation and because as a supervisor we engage with banks as they seek to fulfill their affirmative obligations to meet the credit needs of their communities."
"for example, we can improve the way in which examiners present their analysis in written performance evaluations and provide more opportunities for interagency examiner training."
"i am very impressed with the important ways different kinds of organizations represented in this room are working in partnership to promote economic development here in your community."
"seventeen million jobs have been created in this expansion, and the monthly pace of job growth remains more than sufficient to employ new entrants to the labor force (figure 2)."
"the state of the labor market as i mentioned, the headline unemployment rate has declined to levels not seen since 2000."
"so i will spend a few minutes exploring the state of the job market in some detail."
"real-time estimates of maximum employment are highly uncertain.2 recognizing this uncertainty, the fomc does not set a fixed goal for maximum employment."
"the headline unemployment rate is arguably the best single indicator of labor market conditions."
"for example, to be counted in the official measure as unemployed, a person must have actively looked for a job in the past four weeks.3 people who have not looked for work as recently are counted not as unemployed, but as out of the labor force, even though some of them actually want a job and are available to work."
"others working part time may want a full-time job."
"so, in judging tightness in the labor market, we also look at a range of other statistics, including alternative measures of unemployment, as well as measures of vacancies and job flows, surveys of households' and businesses' perceptions of the job market, and, of course, data on wages and prices."
"the left panel of the next chart shows that employers are having about as much difficulty now attracting qualified workers as they did 20 years ago (figure 4)."
"likewise, the job vacancy rate, shown on the right, is close to its all-time high, as is the average number of weeks it takes to fill a job opening.5 households also are increasingly reporting that jobs are plentiful (figure 5), which is consistent with the high level of job postings reported by firms."
"in addition, the proportion of workers quitting their jobs is high, suggesting that workers are being hired away from their current employers and that others are confident enough about their prospects to leave jobs voluntarily--even before they have landed their next job."
"the labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of working age individuals who are either working or actively looking for a job, has remained steady for about four years (figure 6)."
"indeed, the strong job market does appear to be drawing back some people who have been out of the labor force for a significant time."
"for example, the percentage of adults returning to the labor force after previously reporting that they were not working because of a disability has increased over the past couple of years, and anecdotal reports indicate that employers are increasingly willing to take on and train workers they would not have considered in the past.6 wage growth has also remained moderate, though it has picked up compared with its pace in the early part of this recovery (figure 8)."
"longer-run challenges although job creation is strong and unemployment is low, the u.s. economy continues to face some important longer-run challenges."
"as i noted earlier, the strong economy may continue to pull some prime-age individuals back into the labor force and encourage others not to drop out."
"individuals expecting to be recalled from a temporary layoff are also counted as unemployed whether or not they are actively looking for work."
"these data are from the bureau of labor statistics' job openings and labor turnover survey, or jolts, and start in 2000."

"they also spoke of the day-to-day difficulties of finding, training, and retaining employees."
"but it is an open question as to what portion of the prime-age americans who are out of the labor force may prove responsive to tight labor market conditions because declining labor force participation among prime-age workers predates the crisis, especially for men."
"in one encouraging development, the strong labor market has pulled some discouraged workers back into the labor force and into productive employment over the past few years."
"also encouraging, our beige book and workforce surveys indicate that employers are casting a wider net to find job candidates and investing more in on-the-job training."
"i view that as an important part of my job."
"we have heard from a number of foreign banks that complying with these requirements is unworkable in practice, and we are considering ways to address this impracticality."
"while we know that successful cyber attacks are often connected to poor basic information technology hygiene, and firms must continue to devote resources to these basics, we also know that attackers always work to be a step ahead, and we need to prepare for cyber events."

"for several decades up until the mid-1990s, the share of prime-age people in the labor force rose, as an influx of women more than offset some decline in male participation."

"this low unemployment rate, 3.6 percent in october, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment."
"as the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the october participation rate at a cycle high of 82.8 percent.8 increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures."

"today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the u.s. oil industry."
"measuring the overall level of goods and services produced in the economy is fundamentally messier, because it requires adding apples and orangesâand automobiles and myriad other goods and services."
"until recently, the official data showed job gains over the year through march 2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant."
"several years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm adp to construct a measure of payroll employment from their data set, which covers about 20 percent of the nation's private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one-week delay.15 as described in a recent research paper, we constructed a measure that provides an independent read on payroll employment that complements the official statistics.16 while experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising evidence that it can refine our real-time picture of job gains."

"the strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market."
"for example, african americans and hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10 however, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and, as president daly's research shows, there is some indication these groups especially benefit when the unemployment rate remains very low.11 likewise, the gaps between unemployment rates for less-educated workers and their more-educated counterparts appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12 wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 scope of the review the federal reserve act assigns to the fed the responsibility to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."

"the maximum-employment part of our dual mandate means that the congress has directed us to achieve the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability."
"although the pace of payroll gains has moderated recently, unemployment is at a 50-year low, wages are growing, participation in the labor force has expanded, and unemployment insurance claims are at cycle lows."
"a flat phillips curve has important advantages: the labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers who may have been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation, unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s."
"earlier this month, we held a conference in chicago where we heard from experts as well as community organizations, small businesses, labor organizations, and retirees."

"the job market is strong."
"at 80 percent, the employment rate for workers in their prime working-age yearsâa more comprehensive measure of slack that includes shifts in labor force participation as well as unemploymentâhas recently risen close to its pre-crisis level."
"the bureau of labor statistics' u-6 measure shows that two groups have recently shrunk to pre-crisis levels after rising considerably during the recession: those working part time who would prefer full-time employment and people marginally attached to the labor force who have looked for work in the previous year but stopped looking more recently."
"the strong labor market is leading to employment gains among workers with disabilities."
"research suggests it may be helping to narrow some of the long-standing disparities for some racial minorities, although this development is tentative and modest.8 we hear from business contacts that they are now hiring workers they may not previously have considered."
"during the recession, the evidence suggests that many employers raised their requirements for many job categories."
"as labor markets have tightened, employers in certain sectors, occupations, and areas of the country report they are loosening requirements and investing more in training."
"given that the large majority of working-age households, those at the middle and lower ends of the income distribution, rely primarily on wage income, advancing our employment mandate has served the country well."
"the sustained strengthening of the labor market also adds to the productive capacity of the economy by attracting people on the sidelines to join or rejoin the labor force and move into employment."
"furthermore, the u.s. and foreign economies have evolved significantly since before the crisis."
"there are a number of ways to define middle income."
"it reflects the aging of the population, since households near or in retirement age have the largest accumulated levels of pension savings and are also likely hold a relatively greater share of defined benefit plans (figure 7)."
"while in 1989 more middle-income households had a defined benefit pension than a defined contribution plan, the reverse has been true since 1989.13 with defined contribution plans, employees have to decide how much they will save and how they will invest, and they face uncertainty regarding how much savings will be available in retirement."
"disparities by race and ethnicity this challenge is compounded for some racial and ethnic minority groups that have experienced large and persistent racial gaps in wealth."
"from 2007 to 2018, the share of income spent on rent rose from 18 percent to 25 percent for middle-income renters.26 many middle-income families struggle to afford rent, particularly in the high-demand areas where jobs are most available, underscoring the need for more workforce housing."
"the challenge is to increase accessibility to workforce and affordable housing in ways that address legacy disparities.28 skills, education, and student debt manufacturing and the skilled trades have provided an important pathway to the middle class for many workers, enabling them to own their homes, educate their children, and retire securely."
"today, though, many face uncertainties associated with the decline in manufacturing jobs, the erosion of employee benefits, and reduced bargaining power."
"juan salgado, the chancellor of the city colleges of chicago and our closing keynote speaker, has emphasized the role of community colleges in offering affordable, quality education and training.29 students can begin with a certificate program in advanced manufacturing and continue either to a bachelor's degree in engineering at a nearby public university or to the workplace, acquiring marketable skills likely at lower cost than if they had started at a four-year college."
"graduates with a bachelor's degree have median weekly earnings that are about 65 percent higher than high school graduates and unemployment rates that are 2 percentage points lower, and they are often better positioned to adapt to changes in the labor market.30 however, the cost of higher education has been rising, placing an increasing financial burden on many middle-income households."
"maximum employment, wages, and wealth with lower net worth and financial assets, the livelihoods of most middle-income families, other than retirees, depend primarily on compensation from working."
"while the strengthening of the labor market over the course of this extended recovery has benefited middle-income families, the long-term decline in the share of national income going to wage earners is concerning."
"given that households at the middle of the income distribution rely primarily on wage income, our full employment mandate has served the country well during this extended recovery."
"the gains to workers, including those in the middle class, from the strong labor market are clear."
"labor market disparities by race have been an enduring feature of the labor market for decades."
"the unemployment rate of blacks, while near its historical low, remains at about 7 percent, twice the unemployment rate of whites."
"recent research suggests that the strong labor market may be helping to narrow some of the long-standing disparities for some racial minorities and women, although the results are tentative and very modest.43 the progressive long-term decline in the share of national income that goes to workers through wages is concerning for middle-income households."
"the share going to workersâwhich economists call the labor shareâtranslates into how much of our economic output shows up in people's paychecks."
"earnings have declined as the job market has shifted away from important middle-income occupations."
"manufacturing, for example, employs vastly fewer people now than it has historically.45 it is important to understand the relative importance of these different drivers, as they have different implications for the overall health of the economy and for policies to support middle-income families."
"i am grateful to claudia sahm of the federal reserve board for her assistance in preparing this text, along with barbara lipman, kevin moore, karen pence, paul smith, and mike zabek."

"in 1989, 50 percent of middle-income households had a defined benefit pension, and 29 percent had a defined contribution pension, but by 1998, the relative ownership of each pension type had reversed to 36 percent and 43 percent, respectively."

"u.s. agriculture and its related industries support about 22 million jobs in the united states and produce close to 10 percent of our exports.2 a healthy farm economy also supports many rural and regional economies."
"new mexico is also the nation's second largest producer of pecans, producing a record 92 million pounds worth $220 million in 2017."
"i would like to conclude by recognizing how fortunate we are to have so many highly skilled and experienced farmers and operators, and agricultural lenders who support them."
"modern agriculture is a sophisticated and complex business that requires skilled forecasting of supply and demand, rigorous financial and operational management, and sharp technical expertise."
"for example, on february 12, 2019, the fsb published a comprehensive work program on its website for the year ahead.1 this is the first time in the fsb's history that the work program was disseminated publicly."
"my family has deep roots in rural kansas and a long history in farming, ranching, and ag banking."
"according to the u.s. census bureau, 97 percent of the country's land mass is rural, and about 60 million americans call a rural community their home.1 to put that number in perspective, the rural population of the united states is larger than the combined populations of the new york, los angeles, and chicago metro areas."
"many rural schools struggle to attract and keep qualified teachers who can teach stem and advanced math classes."
"these subjects are vital to preparing our children for the opportunities and challenges of a more competitive and technological workplace.3 one in five people in rural areas have a bachelor's degree, compared to one in three in urban areas.4 this educational disparity helps explain why the employment-to-population and labor force participation rates in rural areas are lower than in many urban areas.5 another contributing factor to low rural labor force participation is the opioid crisis, which the entire nation is struggling to overcome."
"in manufacturing, innovation rates are similar for urban and rural manufacturers, although the services sector in rural areas lags its urban counterparts.7 and, i am greatly encouraged to see younger generations choosing to live in and return to their roots in rural communities, just as my family and i chose to do."
"the topics you are discussing today are integral to my role as governor."
"an important part of my job is to hear directly from leaders like you and others across this country to better understand current challenges facing your communities, your companies, and your industry."
"we participate actively through our community development and examination staff around the country, who help to connect stakeholders, analyze community needs, and assess outcomes."
"branches are the places that provide the personal face-to-face assistance valued by many consumers and business customers."
"bankers and other commenters have emphasized the high value that bank branches have for retail customers and small business owners in underserved communities, and research corroborates this."
"moreover, a broader assessment area for community development activities could help address the concentration of investment dollars in metropolitan areas where several banks may have branches, while other smaller metropolitan and rural areas remain chronically underserved."
"as you know all too well, the current strength of the overall economy masks the struggles many individuals and families face in lower-income urban and rural communities."
"that is why your work as ncrc member organizations offering financial counseling, homeownership education, and technical assistance for small businesses is as important as ever."
"when people are connected to education, training, and other resources that help them secure good jobs and other opportunities, they are better prepared to care for themselves and their families and contribute to a strong economy."
"to complement the work we do with the other regulators to write regulations and guidance implementing cra, the federal reserve system's community development staff help banks understand and meet their responsibilities under the law."
"i commend your dedication to ensuring that all americans have fair access to the economic opportunities that our nation offers."
" thank you for the opportunity to speak here today at the stanford institute for economic policy research, a place dedicated to scholarship supporting policies to better peoples' lives."
"brand, claus, marcin bielecki, and adrian penalver, eds."
"the recent longest-ever government shutdown created hardship for many families and has increased attention on upcoming fiscal negotiations."
"job gains have averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months--more than twice the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force."
"the strong labor market has drawn many americans into productive work, and the overall employment-to-population ratio for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 is now within 1/2 percentage point of its pre-crisis peak."
"it is heartening to see so many american workers coming back into the jobs market with rising wages."
"our business contacts note they are currently hiring and investing in training workers who may not have been considered just a few years ago."
"""estimating the u.s. labor share,"" monthly labor review (february)."
"the employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among the disabled (figure 2).1 and while the unemployment rate for african americans and hispanics remains above the rates for whites and asians, the disparities have narrowed appreciably as the economic expansion has continued."
"more plentiful jobs and rising wages are drawing more people into the workforce and encouraging others who might have left to stay."
"we refer to output per hour of work as ""labor productivity."""
"to be counted as ""in the labor force,"" a person must either be employed or have looked for work within the past four weeks."
"the share of people of working age who are actually in the labor force has fallen significantly since the late 1990s."
"the fraction of this age group who are neither in school nor in the labor force has held fairly constant at around 11 percent, and measures of school enrollment are up.5 higher educational attainment is much more important in today's job market than in the past, and investing in education today has long-term benefits for both the student and for society.6 statistics confirm that higher educational attainment is associated with higher labor force participation, lower unemployment, and higher wages."
"i strongly believe policies that bring prime-age workers into productive employment, particularly those who may have been left behind because of low skills or educational attainment, could bring great benefits both to those workers and to our economy."
"standard reasoning holds that capital-per-worker drives productivity."
"we need policies that support innovation and create a favorable environment for investment in both the skills of workers and the tools they have."
"tonight i have also highlighted some longer-term challenges we face, including low labor force participation by prime-age workers and low productivity growth."
"the nation would benefit greatly from a search for policies with broad appeal that could promote labor force participation and higher productivity, with benefits shared broadly across the nation."
"in 2018, about 8 percent of the population aged 16 to 64 reported themselves as having a disability, and their labor force participation rate was 33 percent."
"it is also true that a smaller share of students are holding down a job while in school."
"for example, brynjolfsson, mitchell, and rock (2018) highlight the need to make complimentary investments in intangibles to take advantage of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies (see erik brynjolfsson, tom mitchell, and daniel rock (2018), ""what can machines learn and what does it mean for occupations and the economy?"""
" thank you for the opportunity to participate in the 35th annual economic policy conference of the national association for business economics."
"the unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 years, and average monthly job gains have continued to well outpace the increases needed over the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force."
"moreover, the strength of the labor market appears to have encouraged people to join the labor force and others, who might have left it, to continue working."
"there is a stubbornly persistent lack of diversity in the economics profession.2 year after year, minorities and women are underrepresented in the pool of individuals awarded a doctorate in economics in the united states relative to their share in the broader population, and the gap is especially acute for women of color."
"the american economic association reports that in the 2016-17 academic year, seven black/african american women were awarded a doctorate in economics in the united states, along with eight black/african american men, out of a total pool of 1,150 economics ph.d.'s awarded overall."
"the economics diversity gap starts even earlier.3 as amanda bayer and david wilcox have documented, women and minorities are also underrepresented in undergraduate economics programs."
"but our footprint is especially large in the economics job market, where as a system we routinely hire one of every 25 newly minted economics ph.d.'s each year."
"i recognize that it is challenging to look around a classroom or conference room and not see colleagues who you can relate to."
"there are many opportunities for you in the field of economics, both here and abroad, in government, academia, and the private sector."
"among u.s. citizens and permanent residents earning doctorates, the representation of those identifying as black, hispanic, or native american among the pool of doctorate recipients improved from 6 percent in 1995 to 11 percent in 2007."

"today i'll speak about three areas of opportunity for addressing the challenges of rural povertyââeducation and workforce development, entrepreneurship and small business development, as well as access to financial services--the topic of this conference."
"i want to honor you for this proud history and for your continuing commitment to a better future for your students and for the region where many of your students were born and will build their lives and raise their families.1 challenges and opportunities in poor rural communities today, data at the national level show a strong economy."
"in appalachia for instance, timber, coal mining, tobacco, and textiles have long been in decline.3 likewise, the number of jobs in agriculture and low-skilled manufacturing, mainstays of the delta's economy, is decreasing as a result of automation and outsourcing.4 education and workforce development high-quality education and training play a crucial role in extending opportunity in rural areas, starting with early childhood education.5 but in many rural communities, access to high-quality preschool education is limited."
"mississippi is one of several mostly rural states where nearly half of residents lack access to good quality childcare, which is the main source of early childhood education.6 many decades of research also confirm that children who grow up in areas with better-quality k-12 schools or in classes with higher-quality teachers have better outcomes in life.7 later in life, workforce training and education are most effective when they train workers in skills needed by local employers."
"rural areas where traditional industries are declining and where new employers may be moving in often experience a mismatch between the skills of local workers and those demanded by the new employers."
"training and retraining programs tend to be centralized and concentrated in areas with a higher population density, which puts many rural areas at a disadvantage.8 education benefits both the student and the community."
